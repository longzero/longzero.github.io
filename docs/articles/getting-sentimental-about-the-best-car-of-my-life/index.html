  <p>Ah. cette auto... Elle va me manquer.</p>
<p>I don't get attached to things, but this car... This car will forever be associated with my summer 2022.</p>
<p>Alas, the right thing to do, for the future I want, is to find a different vehicle.</p>
<p>At the time I write this, I still own it, but I feel the end is nigh.</p>
<p>At only 144 000 kilometers, it still has a very long life, but it won't be with me.</p>
<p>It is absolutely the perfect car for anybody living in and around a city. It's also perfect to occasionally going doing distances like Montreal-Toronto or Montreal-NYC.</p>
<p>If you want, it will do Montreal-Los Angeles easily. Like I said, it still has a very long life.</p>
<p>Five years, ago, I purchased this car at an incredible price of 8000 CAD and it had only 75 000 kilometers on the odometer. It was a bargain.</p>
<p>Today, with 144 000 kilometers, it's worth over 10 000 CAD.</p>
<p>I find that completely insane!</p>
<p>As I write all this, I am thinking of keeping it even when I get another vehicle more appropriately for living on the road... Perhaps I could put it up for rent...</p>
<p>I hate getting sentimental about objects. Despite my feelings, I still very much recognize that it is just a car, just an object.</p>
<p>I use this photo to associate with this article because it wasn't easy to get to this specific spot. The road was very rocky, sandy and steep. Before going up there, I parked and walked to the slope to get a clearer picture and said “This looks like crap and I will probably fail, but I'm going to take this shot.”</p>
<p>I took the shot, I didn't fail and the prize was this magnificent view full of peace, serenity and joie de vivre with strong feelings of amazement and accomplishment.</p>
<p>It was also the full moon which kept me up because it was so bright and I was in awe.</p>
<p>This could very well be a sentimental ad to sell it... It really is an incredible car and I do have other arguments to sell it, such as how spacious it is for a seemingly tiny car.</p>
