  <p>The <a href="/articles/rebekkas-website-the-beginnings-1-of-2/">first post</a> I made on this subject was about everything that occurred before I started working on <a href="http://www.rebekkagudleifs.com/">Rebekka’s website</a>. This one will be about how I ended up making the website the way it is.</p>
<p>“if i have a site done i want it to be very simple, user friendly to the point” is what Rebekka told me.</p>
<p>I have heard the words “simple” and “user friendly” before. My whole life, the way I do things, the way I work, the way I interact, the way I… is all centered around “simple”. The design for my very own website does justice to that.</p>
<p>I have never been told “to the point” before. What that meant to me, web design-wise, is no useless flash animation with a very useful skip button. It also meant that the subject of the website should be unmistakable, even with the word “photography” no where to be found on the website.</p>
<p>Her photos are the most important thing. I started out with one big photo and then I layed out everything else around. The quality of the photos is the only thing that matters. I wanted people to come on the website and say “nice photos” rather than “nice website”. Every single page of the website has the big area for a photo. There are no thumbnails page. By laying out things this way, I believe to have accomplished all three points (simple, user friendly and to the point) of Rebekka’s request.</p>
<p>“One thing i hate about my flickr page is the white background. Just not a good way to display photos.”</p>
<p>She didn’t like the white background on flickr, so I went to the other extreme: black background. Just as simple as that.</p>
<p>“i’m very pleased with the colors (the green is just perfect, that color is just me in a nutshell:p)”</p>
<p>The text color is gray rather than white for the simple reason that I wanted to reduce the contrast so that the photos always stand out. About the greenish color, I got it from her signature on her <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rebba/32296282/">most favorited photo</a> (at this time). Rebekka didn’t tell me to do it, but since she used that color for her signature, it just made sense to me to use it.</p>
<p>“i’m very happy with the site”</p>
<p>I’m also very happy with the site. If I had to describe this website in one sentence, I would say that it’s simple, user friendly and to the point.</p>
