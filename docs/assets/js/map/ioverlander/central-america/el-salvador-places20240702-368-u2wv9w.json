The two crater hikes also take armed police escorts for security.\r\na) a short 45min circular trail. Can go anytime. Trail is free, pay guide a tip (suggested $1).\r\nb) Izalco crater hike. 5hrs. Guide said it is steep \u0026 challenging. Rarely goes on weekdays unless pre-booked for a group. Demand is low due to the challenge but there's usually enough people at the weekends. Price $6 pp (foreigners) for trail in a special volcano zone, + $1 pp for guide. Leaves only at 11:00 hrs (no other times).\r\nc) Santa Ana crater hike. 4 hrs. Goes everyday (except rarely if less than 4 people turn up). Bit steep in parts but not too challenging. Leaves only at 11.00hrs. Must leave the crater rim at 13:00hrs to come down. If you are slow going up, you may have very little time at the top. This hike leaves from the main park (here) but the first section is steep downhill to Hotel Tibet.  You can intercept and join the hike either at Hotel Tibet at around 11:10 (you can park here for $2) or at the Santa Ana entry point at around 11:20 (see on maps.me and iOv - this is good if you are camping at Casa Cristal). There are 2 benefits with these 'shortcuts': (i) you don't pay the park entry fee to get to the start point; and (ii) you don't have to walk all the way back up the steep hill to the start-point to get your car afterwards. Hike price is $6+$1pp. \r\nWe did the Santa Ana hike from the start point and really regretted not having joined them at Hotel Tibet instead. By going to the start you pay the extra park entrance money just to do a tiring and boring section of the hike (walking back up at the end was hell!! 😐).

Lured to the town on the promise of security, the citizens were separated into groups with the men locked in the church, and women and both girls and boys in nearby houses.  The next day the torture and killing began, men first, then the older women.  Young children were last.  Only one person escaped to tell the tale of what happened that day.  Others had fled before the invasion to the surrounding area east of Rio Sapo and therefore survived as well.\r\n\r\nToday there is a memorial in the village commemmorating the names and ages of those who lost their lives in El Mozote, Guacamaya and the other hamlets.\r\n\r\nWe were greeted upon arrival by a woman who told us the history of the event.  A small display shows photographs of the aftermath (not suitable for children), and there are books and CDs (in Spanish) you can purchase, along with handicrafts -- the money goes to help the ongoing effort to educate visitors about the tragic happenings (or you can make a contribution).\r\n\r\nThis makes a nice companion stop to the Museum of the Revolution in nearby Perquin.

He invited us to stay in his fields and said they are planning a camp area. He also plans to ride a motorcycle down the Pan American. It’s a great location, tucked away around the back of the farm in a grassy area up in a hill. The farm recently opened a cafe selling coffee (to drink, maybe beans too), cheese, milk and honey (all farm produced) as well as having young cow feeding times for kids and things like sugar cane crushing. \r\n\r\nThe bus to and from Juayúa is just 20c and you can catch it outside the farm or head 5 mins up the road to the small town of San Jose de Mojada and catch it from there.\r\n\r\nHe is happy to have Overlanders stay, he let us use the toilet and shower in the guest building and there is water available too if you need a tank fill (likely clean but not potable). They have electricity you can use but not at the site. You have the choice of where to stay in the fields, we chose the back corner as recommended by him. Some tight-ish corners through the farm but we were in easy enough in a long bed full ton Dodge Ram 3500 + camper. No height clearance issues.\r\n\r\nWe planned to stay a night and stayed two. Felt very welcome and secure, quiet too. The farm is also guarded at night. Expect an enthusiastic welcome from a pack of dachshunds and you may, like us, spot a quetzal in the trees nearby. A great stop for kids and adults alike. Check out the pictures for a better idea).\r\n\r\nWe were not charged. I am not sure this will continue forever, who knows. We purchased some cheese and milk etc. Alvaro seems to love travel more than profit :)\r\n\r\nRight next to a cell tower for full bars 3G Tigo (10 Mbs)and full bars LTE Claro (41Mbs ... yes, forty one!). Tested by Ookla. \r\n\r\nHappy to be adding this first, great friendly hosts. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nDirections: Just at the corner into/out of town you will see a bright red shed which is the cafe.

They all left towards sundown and we had the entire expansive property to ourselves. There were horses wondering about, and cattle grazing the lawns at night.  Starry sky and quiet all night.

In the back, there is room for several vans or motorhomes or like us, a trailer.\r\nBe careful, water is scarce. There are days when there is no municipal water. So fill your tanks before.

In my humble opinion there is no guide necessary, given that you bring the necessary fitness (know that there is around 1200 m to ascend and descend with partly slippery terrain).\r\n\r\nThe trail to the top is very easy to follow once you found the start of the trail (for that see the picture and my description attached). The trail on maps.me is very accurate beside the entry point and the first 500m. \r\n\r\nThe beginning of the trail goes through what is currently a construction site (they are developing a whole neighbourhood on the side of the volcano), so this is kind of a private/restricted property. To avoid any discussion if crossing that area is allowed or not, I started my hike before 6:00 am (so none of the workers was there yet) and just bypassed the gate (I met them on my way down, I greeted friendly and noone seemed to care). The first third of the trail follows a dirt road (again see map.me or Google satellite), that's very easy to follow.\r\nOn the second part of the trail, you will hike a narrow path. Dont worry, you cant loose the trail, there is only a single path and even marks on trees or rocks (long trousers recommended to not scratch your legs).\r\nEventually you will reach the last part of the trail which goes through volcanic ash and rocks (here hiking sticks are a great help). If you are in a group I recommend to stay close to each other (or at least dont hike above each other) as there is a lot of loose rocks that you might trigger. When you enter the crater just memorize where you entered, then leave the same way. \r\n\r\nHere some more info:\r\n- we found a nice and quiet place to sleep in our camper in las placitas, only a few minutes from the entry gate. That way it's easy to start the hike early\r\n- as you start the hike at 900m altitude it is not very hot + if you go early morning you will be on the shadow side of the volcano. No need to carry 5 liters of water..\r\n- a guide costs around 60$ and can be found in las placitas quite easily (every man is basically a guide...)\r\n- check the wheater conditions before the hike. When I was there the top got very cloudy at around 9am and only cleared up in the afternoon. You might want to avoid hiking through thick clouds with reduced visibility\r\n- I would guess the hike takes around 3,5 h up and 2h down for average hikers. However, a fast hiker could do it in 2,5h up and 1h down.","location":{"latitude":13.454182,"longitude":-88.296575},"category":{"name":"Tourist Attraction"}},{"id":255760,"name":"Rancho Punta tremedio los cobano","date_verified":"2024-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Safe place to spend a night in front of ocean. friendly owner. very basic campground, but maybe a good solution for a night or two. they asked 15$ for a van. \r\n","location":{"latitude":13.52610251,"longitude":-89.80262202},"category":{"name":"Informal Campsite"}},{"id":256404,"name":"Maury‘s Bike","date_verified":"2024-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Bike shop repairs bicycles and sells parts.

It's a mountaintop with a killer view, magical sunrises and sunsets, and various sleeping options. \r\n\r\nTo access it you need to go through Nombre de Dios, and then it's about a 45-minute drive up to the tiny village of Las Aradas (appears on Google Maps but not Maps.me), and a little further to the trailhead, then ditch your vehicle and hike. I went during the dry season and initially they said it would be accessible by 4x4 only, then took a look at my RWD Chevy Astro and said it might pass - there were a couple of patches of road with soft sand where I fishtailed a little, but made it ok - saw a couple of bikers ahead of me struggle to maintain control, but they made it too. Not sure how it would be during the rainy season. Also not sure where anything bigger than a small van would park - maybe in Las Aradas and hike up from there, you could ask in Nombre de Dios. The other option is to take a transport from town; $20 each way - ask at the Commercial Liliana on the plaza, a couple of doors down from the Neveria.\r\n\r\nFrom the end of the road it's about an hour's fairly steep hike to the top - most is very exposed and it gets very hot even quite early on, so be prepared if you come during thr day. Horses available at Las Aradas for those who would prefer one. There's an obvious fork in the path towards the top - right takes you to the marked point, Eramon Paradise 360⁰, and left to Camping Eramon. They're only about a 10 minute walk apart - there's another path that connects them over the top too. \r\n\r\nEramon Paradise is fancy - various options for camping and glamping, cabins, different miradors, one of those scary swing things (similar to Hobbitanango, outside of Antigua Guatemala, for those who've been there). There's also a restaurant for pupusas ($1 each), soft drinks, bottled water and more, and toilet block, I think a shower too, though it didn't look as though there was any running water while I was there. They charge $5 to enter, and I think $7.50 to camp, with various equipment available to hire - I believe tents were $8.\r\n\r\nCamping Eramon is a much more basic setup and still under construction, but usable. I slung my hammock up inside an adobe hut to get out of the breeze; they charged me $5. Tents and mattresses usually available to rent too. Less likely to find food there though - I went and ate some pupusas at the other place after sunset (they didn't charge me to enter - though wanted to the following morning when we went to ask about breakfast, and $5 for breakfast), and then hiked over to this one for the night. Got chilly overnight!\r\n\r\nA fair few resident dogs, all friendly, though one looked more than a little battle-scarred. No signs saying pets not allowed that I saw.\r\n\r\nFrom Camping Eramon there's a hike to a further, lower hill that gives you a great open view over the beautiful meandering river system and surrounding mountains - it took a good 20 or 25 minutes, much longer than I expected! But well worth it for the sunrise views.\r\n\r\nIn summary - not the easiest place to get to, but the view justifies the effort!

Carmelo’s beach-front location is directly on the long, sandy, beautiful beach attached to the short and rocky beach of Punta Mango. He owns a few large palapas with hammocks, tables, chairs, outdoor showers, and a flushing toilet. A 2-minute walk down the beach is an empty sandy lot he is developing with a friend for camping. Currently you drive onto the beach and then into his lot. You can also use his facilities and hangout spot. However, they are in the process of building a road directly onto the lot to cut out the beach drive. The current road onto the beach is definitely 4x4 required. Getting down was pretty easy, but we needed 4x4 and airing down our tires to get back up in our Sprinter van. You can’t drive the beach at high tide. It was $5 USD/night per person. The pin is marking where our van was parked. To get there, drive down the “Punta Mango Access Road” that has the Punta Mango Hotel and Restaurant at the end. The lot will be on your right before you reach the hotel. It might have a gate, so text Carmelo on WhatsApp to let him know you are coming! +503 6860 3836. This will likely become unnecessary when the road is finished being built.

BUT it's dangerous in rainy season (may-nov) : We were sleeping in our van and a storm started, after 15 minuts of heavy rain, this street was like a river, it was very scary, the current was strong and the water level was over the sidewalk. We jumped to the driver sit, started the van and left right away, and took the road up, everything was fine on that street and we spent the night there. I think in dry season wouldn't be a problem staying here. \r\n~ \r\nCalle tranquila y nivelada, con sombra, buen lugar p parquear y dormir. PERO es peligroso en época lluviosa (mayo-nov): estábamos durmiendo en la van y comenzó una tormenta, después de 15 minutos de fuerte lluvia, esta calle parecía un RIO, fue horrible, la corriente era fuerte y el nivel del agua llegaba hasta la vereda. Saltamos a la cabina, arrancamos y nos fuimos enseguida, tomamos la calle que va en subida y estaba todo bien en la calle de arriba así q pasamos la noche ahí. Creo q en temporada seca no habría problema de dormir acá.","location":{"latitude":13.979039,"longitude":-89.566213},"category":{"name":"Warning"}},{"id":279247,"name":"Finca Rauda","date_verified":"2023-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","description":"We didnt camp here but saw on our way out of town that it is $6 to camp here.
