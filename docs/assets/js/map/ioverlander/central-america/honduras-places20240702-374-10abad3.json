The adventure starts the moment you hit the dirt road in San Geronimo and drive 20kms through the mountains of Parque Nacional Montaña de Comayagua to reach the community of Rio Negro (4x4 and high clearance highly recommended). The Velazquez Family owns an organic coffee farm (the brother of Avelio sells it in Minnesota!) and have opened up their beautiful land to folks to camp on. 75L per car per night. No bathrooms for campers (yet!) but they can open up one of their cabanas for you to use, if needed. No wifi but they do have electricity (not at sites). As of now, there are two areas to camp - near the river or at \"the vista,\" which is flat and has an incredible view of the valley. Bertilia, the wife of Avelio, is also a great cook (vegetarian chorizo!) and offers breakfast, lunch, and dinner for an extra cost. And when you're wanting something active, you can take a hike through dense forest up to two waterfalls: Los Ensueños (50 min) and La Gavilán (1.5 hours and ~70m tall!!). No need for a guide - the trail is well-marked.

Prices are really cheap: 330$ for the PADi and you get free accommodation for 4 nights as well as 2 fun dives if you take a class, otherwise the price for accomodation is 8$ for a shared dorm. There are several private dorms that accommodate 2 people so if you get lucky only, you can have one of these rooms for the same price (and the room has its own bathroom). You can also easily upgrade to a more expensive private room with AC for 40$.\r\n\r\nWith regards to the diving course; I was really impressed by so much professionalism.

Getting to the first check point I stopped and one guy approached us but never saw him again as I told him I didn’t need help.\r\n\r\nI went to the guys in the little booth and asked them if they could cancel my TIP. They thoroughly checked if I really wanted to cancel or if I wanted to return, seemed like they really cared. Some of this was with Google Translate since my Spanish is minimalistic and their English non-existent, again they put effort in helping. We needed two copies, which we could make across the street for 1QT per side (two pages double sides = 4QT).\r\n\r\nChecked VIN, stamped, had a nice chat (hence; I practised my Spanish) and we drove on.\r\n\r\nAbout 2km down the road there’s a bigger building, Guatemala and Honduras are together in one office here, worked out well.\r\n\r\nBut as we got closer there was a gate, two guys in what seemed a uniform and many around them (including the ones operating the gate) without. I didn’t trust them as they asked for papers and they didn’t open the gate, I reversed.\r\n\r\nThe one guy who asked me for papers followed me and I “explained” that I just wanted to pass through and wanted to do the paperwork inside. Now out of a sudden the gate could be opened (operated by non-officials going off their uniform).\r\n\r\nWe were asked by a “helper” (who spoke decent English) if we really didn’t want help and we kindly declined his offer. At least he was straight forward and pushy.\r\n\r\nPark behind the gate, went inside, got stamped out of Guatemala and stamped into Honduras at the cost of $3 paid in American cash. (Local currency would also have been possible.)\r\n\r\nNext the TIP, which was done by the guy who I didn’t trust outside and I apologised for my behaviour and explained the situation was confusing.\r\n\r\nHe collected copies, and started filling out paperwork. Somewhere along the line he mentioned we had to pay $35 per bank, but the bank was closed (since it was night time) and I needed to transfer online. I said no problem since I have internet (Google Fi) and asked where I should send the money to. He said it can only be done with a local bank and he wasn’t  able to accept cash.\r\n\r\nThere was a guy who he introduced (local) and he could transfer the money for me and I pay him in USD cash. I accepted without asking his commission. All the paperwork done, stamped and signed, I asked his commission.\r\n\r\nWith the help of Google Translate he said $50, I refused. Then he said $15, I refused again. He tried to explain it was his “work” and I told him it wasn’t an acceptable percentage.\r\n\r\nWith the paperwork done, now out of a sudden it was possible to pay the guy in cash, who we paid $35 and all was done.\r\n\r\nSo be careful, they tried to rip us off working together, luckily didn’t work.\r\n\r\nThe Guatemala officer checked VIN, collected the sticker from the windscreen, stamped two copies and off we went.","location":{"latitude":14.531309,"longitude":-89.283032},"category":{"name":"Customs and Immigration"}},{"id":91278,"name":"Unimall Choluteca","date_verified":"2024-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Parking lot at Unimall Plaza, Choluteca.

There is a huge gate that is shut at night and lots of security cameras around surveilled by reception. \r\n\r\nAlso there is a pool which looks well maintained but we didn’t swim in it.\r\n\r\nEdit: We stayed here again on our way back up north. Paid 800L for a room without a small kitchen and still equally as safe and clean. Shower was the best one I’ve had in months - consistently hot with good pressure.","location":{"latitude":13.307937417283355,"longitude":-87.19334622912025},"category":{"name":"Hotel"}},{"id":274146,"name":"Unpaved road","date_verified":"2024-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","description":"A big part of the road is unpaved, I think it‘s better to take the CA13 from La Ceiba -\u003e Trujillo","location":{"latitude":15.758368370929636,"longitude":-85.99817808142497},"category":{"name":"Warning"}},{"id":274174,"name":"Casa Vieja Hotel y Restaurante","date_verified":"2024-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Nice little hotel between the two borders.
