Crime reported in this location! Please use caution! \r\n\r\nPlease be aware safe secure camping and parking spot is just up the road for a small charge. \r\n\r\nJune 14th, 2023: We would like to report a robbery attack that occurred not far from here two days ago. We believe it is crucial to inform you about what happened to us for the safety of others. The incident took place near Laguna Cuicocha at a spot where campers often spend the night. At that place, we were targeted in a robbery attempt. We had been there for a few hours when I noticed some suspicious movement in the nearby bushes. Suddenly, three individuals wearing masks and armed with metal rods and a machete attacked me. Fortunately, they did not manage to harm me physically, but their intention quickly turned towards our van where Evelin was inside. I cannot stress enough how terrifying the situation became, and it all unfolded rapidly. Evelin, upon hearing and witnessing the attack on me, bravely opened the door. Two of the assailants attempted to enter the van, but she defended herself by using a pepper spray on them, spraying right into their eyes. I somehow managed to make my way to the door and entered the van, despite the third attacker's attempt to pull me out. Fortunately, Evelin was also able to spray him with the pepper spray too, and we were able to close the door. Immediately, we started the engine and tried to flee the scene. In the process, our Starlink antenna was dragged on the road for several hundred meters. Shockingly, a pickup truck pursued us for about 20 minutes. It is important to note that this is a spot where many overlanders go to spend the night. Eventually, we returned to the previous campsite we camped before, Finca Sommerwind. Thankfully, we are both shaken but physically unharmed. We consider ourselves incredibly fortunate, as this ordeal could have had far worse consequences. It is evident that the attackers had been observing us for some time, waiting for an opportunity to strike when one of us ventured outside. If that had not occurred, they likely would have targeted us later in the night by smashing one of the windows, as indicated by the metal rods they possessed. Our initially pleasant wild camping experience quickly transformed into a horrifying event. We have included the coordinates of the location where the incident took place: 0.2926, -78.34817 Do not camp here under any circumstances.","location":{"latitude":0.2926,"longitude":-78.34817},"category":{"name":"Warning"}},{"id":1295,"name":"Cascada De Peguche Waterfall Car Park","date_verified":"2023-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","description":"You can stay in the parking of the cascada.

This path is the best option to reach the waterfall. A good trail goes down to the entrance. Entrance costs $3 for adults and $2 for children aged 5 to 11. There you continue up on steps, to different balconies, halfway to the huge waterfall. At the opposite of the first balcony you can enter a small tunnel, that brings you to the side of the waterfall. Be prepared for a shower. Once back at the entrance, you go down and can cross a hanging bridge. From the other side the complete waterfall is visible. It’s amazing, worth the money! The other path makes you only to the top of the waterfall, where you cannot see the complete falls. Also there you cross hanging bridges, and go close to the falls. But there is no way down. It’s organised by another company, so if you want to do both, you pay twice.\r\n","location":{"latitude":-1.4018439687801543,"longitude":-78.29721336260279},"category":{"name":"Tourist Attraction"}},{"id":5264,"name":"Cotopaxi climbing guide","date_verified":"2022-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Gaspar Navarrete - +593 99 328 9418.

But you don't need to do that. In fact, do not do that. It costs more than necessary. If you get here by your own means, sleep in your own rig and cook your own meals, you would only be paying for guided tours. Just drive to Rio Blanco, park in front of Mama Ines' tienda and ask for her or her son Hengry. There is electricity, flushing toilet, running water and a porch to sit but everything is very basic. Hengry told us that $10 to $15 is sufficient based on the daily time he spends guiding around. He also mentioned a $20 community fee but it sounded like that would be a one time payment. Be aware that the tienda has very simple provisions and they may not be able to provide food if you show up without notice. Rainforest hikes, river and waterfall swims, handcraft demonstrations, farming, trap building, local cooking and Shamanic ayahuasca ceremony are among the things you can experience. Make sure to leave your orientalist 'Amazonian native' illusions behind. You won't be seeing blowpipe hunters walking around butt-naked. Your perceptions of authenticity will probably have to change a bit.","location":{"latitude":-1.0063412692407205,"longitude":-77.5640740246303},"category":{"name":"Informal Campsite"}},{"id":5296,"name":"Hosteria Hacienda San Joaquin Cotopaxi","date_verified":"2024-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","description":"$7.50 per person. great place to stay off the PanAm (@ exit Parque Nacional Cotopaxi) and to acclimatize for Cotopaxi National Park. very clean washrooms \u0026 hot showers.

He is hoping though that postCovid times will bring back the business and once the lodges are fully booked again, nobody will say anything against an extra income for the locals. We were lucky, that the rangers managed to phone up an agency in Quito to book us in for an overnight trip to one of the lodges.\r\nIt's best to book ahead before you get here as there is neither a WiFi  nor a cellphone connection.

It was the only place that we got to see the yellow land iguana.  They also have Lonesome George - the world's last Pinta tortoise - on display (he died in 2012, so it's just his embalmed body now). \n\nIf you want to camp out at Garrapatero beach this is also the place to ask permission from the national parks service (unfortunately we couldn't, due to wild weather that had wiped out the camping area). \n\nBring your snorkel - we took a dip at the Playa Estacion over here and swam with baby galapagos sharks, spotted Eagle rays, a swarm of golden rays, marine iguanas and plenty of stingrays digging in the sandy bottom... Go to your far left as you enter the water (for rays) and then go straight out to the mouth of the bay (for sharks).  We went twice in the afternoon. Really lovely, and free!

The boat is fairly basic - it's a long river boat with open sides, seating for approx 70 people, life jackets, a bathroom, and shelter from the sun / rain. \r\n\r\nIt's a (long) peaceful journey (you will probably doze through most of it), interesting to see the communities (and Petro Ecuador) on the river, and there's beautiful scenery of course. \r\n\r\nPhotos of the timetables and contact details of boat companies are attached. \r\n\r\nTIMETABLE:\r\n\r\nCOCA \u003e ROCAFUERTE (approx 10 hours)\r\n\r\nMonday 0730 (CTF)\r\nWednesday 0730 (CTF)\r\nThursday 0730 (CTF)\r\nSaturday 0730 (Kamu Kamu)\r\nSunday 0730 (Kamu Kamu)\r\n\r\nROCAFUERTE \u003e COCA (approx 12 hours)\r\n\r\nMonday 0530 (Kamu Kamu)\r\nWednesday 0500 (CTF)\r\nThursday 0530 (Kamu Kamu)\r\nSaturday 0500 (CTF)\r\nSunday 0500 (CTF)\r\n\r\n* no pets are allowed onboard.

The above was correct as at December 2017, but if in doubt just turn up in Coca - you can probably find a boat going downriver every day, or charter one.","location":{"latitude":-0.47356,"longitude":-76.98235},"category":{"name":"Tourist Attraction"}},{"id":48649,"name":"Sierra Alisos","date_verified":"2023-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Idyllic setting, panoramic views of multiple surrounding volcanoes including Cotopaxi, situated alongside the huge forest reserve that they own.

This road isn't shown on Google Maps and Maps.me showed it as a footpath (on OSM as a grade 4 track now), but it is a reasonable road. The last section (1-2km) is dirt but good condition WHEN DRY. We got up here in a 4 tonne RWD Roadtrek but after a night and day of rain the dirt section was absolutely treacherous and I wouldn't recommend it unless you have a 4x4.\r\n\r\nWALK: on the way up we took the little footpath behind where we parked horizontally over the quebrada, vertically up to a track, then left to the small white water plant building where we found the official footpath (approx 300m). On the way down we took a farmer's track which brought us to the road we parked on about a 100m up. Both fairly easy if you track on Maps.me.\r\nThere is a thousand metres climb to the top in about 5-6km, so you can imagine it's pretty relentless. It wasn't the altitude or evelation gain that made it hard, but the quality of the track as the lower half is through grasslands that turn into a muddy slick mess when wet. The higher track is also muddy but more rocky so not as bad. I'd strongly recommend walking poles or at least a stick. \r\nFortunately the track is pretty easy to follow, even in thick clouds. It took us (mid fitness 40s) about 4 hours up and about 3 down. \r\n\r\nSLEEP: At 3,500m the road turns into a more narly and narrow 4x4 track, but there is ample room to park up for the night. You might be able to squeeze two vehicles here at a push, but you can always find something a little lower (didn't see anything higher).

The second night at about 10 pm I couldn't sleep because someone was talking/yelling so loud, and it was the front dest lady talking loudly/yelling to someone on the second floor. I asked her politely to quiet down so I could go to sleep, it was obvious she was annoyed by my request but after about 10 minutes she was quiet. Right next door to the hotel is a ferreteria, with a large yard, they locked the gate at night with two large dogs that barked pretty much the whole night the second night. The TV reception and the wifi was horrible. When I went to check out the guy at the front desk questioned whether I paid for the second night, which totally amazed me since I paid HIM the afternoon before. I'm sure he was trying to scam me, but I stood my ground and would not pay. Partially my fault because I noticed they didn't write anything down when I was checking in, and I should've gotten a receipt.

If you are looking for a quiet place in between beautiful mountains north of Cuenca, this is your place.\r\nLuke, Julie and their 5 kids have migrated from the United States and now own 90 hectares of pasture and native forest where they offer private quaint wooden cabins for rental. \r\nThey offer a two-bedroom chalet and a two-bedroom bungalow for 35 dollars a night. Just recently, they finished an awesome treehouse with spectacular views with one bedroom for couples that they rent for 40 dollars. A delicious artesan breakfast with their dairy products is included. All cabins have a small kitchen, hot water 24/7, electricity, a wood stove and WIFI. No problem to park your vehicle here. \r\nWe were staying at the farm for a month, working as volunteers because we got a recommendation from other traveler friends. We had such a good time here. It was a nice break after 15 months of travelling and honestly the best cheese in whole South America. This family and landscape are just amazing!

I spent 1 night here while on a solo bike tour. I was ascending to El Tambo on the E40. Manager Manuel said I could camp there under cover next to his restaurtante for free. He said veicle tourists could camp in his large parking lot, also for free.\r\n\r\nSee photos, at the end of Day 8 of my blog: http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/SAm19tim . I enjoyed my covered camp spot next to Manuel’s restaurante. This had convenient chairs. He is a nice guy and likes cyclists. Pros: camped on concrete under a roof. Flush toilet with sink and water. (No TP or soap). (Cold) shower. 110V inside and also outside in the camping area (high up on one of the outer posts). I enjoyed Saturday lunch in his restaurant and had worthwhile discussions with him, his relatives and various guests. Restaurant was open 05h00 – 20h30. It was closed when I left (Sunday) as it was voting day. Cons. Until late, it was a bit noisy from passing trucks. Still, I slept OK. Wi-Fi was available in the kitchen but did not reach the dining area. I recommended he move the router (which was hidden behind a wall) to give it an unobstructed view of the dining area. Guests perhaps don't mind, but if more cyclists or vehcile travelers arrived and asked for Wi-Fi he would probably move it.\r\n\r\nManuel said camping was free, but I thought it worth $5, which I gave him. I encourage others to do the same. This would likely motivate him to make his Wi-Fi available in the dining area.","location":{"latitude":-2.46611,"longitude":-79.17268},"category":{"name":"Informal Campsite"}},{"id":88387,"name":"Cancha (Sports Stadium) de Voleibol y Basquetbol, Ducur","date_verified":"2019-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","description":"I spent 1 night here while on a solo bike tour. I was ascending to El Tambo on the E40. See photos and captions, Day 9 of my blog:http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/SAm19tim. I much enjoyed my overnight here. A very good free camp. Pros: indoors, in a secure environment. After the building had been closed for the night, I could leave anytime via a locked side door, but once out could not return as the side door needed padlocking from outside. Smooth concrete floor for tent. Bathrooms (unisex) with flush toilets and washbasins. (No TP or soap). No 110V but a power cable was provided by my hostess Mary. Cons: Very festive until 21h00 with well-behaved if bouncy kids, adults and soccer games. (For me, the kids were a pro). Bright lights until about 22h00, then quiet and dark. Street dogs barked off-and-on during the night, but weren’t too loud. I slept well.\r\n\r\nFrom Thurs evening thru Sun evening, Mary ran a small café inside the Volleyball/Basketball Sports building (“La Cancha de Voleibol y Basquetbol”). She said sure, I could camp inside the building. A kind and helpful lady. My assigned space was covered and secure, with space for perhaps 6 tents. Bathrooms and water were close by. The Cancha would be open until about 22h00 when she locked up and went home, to return at 08h00 the next morning. However, she would not padlock the steel gate next to where I was to camp (see photo). I could slide back the bolt on the inside and leave earlier. Others seeking a good camping area in Ducur should visit the Cancha and ask for Mary or Anibal (see note below). Mary had a few tables with 110V in her café, where one could use one’s laptop and charge electronics. She offered coffee (basic but cheap- $0.30), and French fries with fried chicken ($0.50 – a good deal).\r\n\r\nI asked about Wi-Fi in Ducur, and was told by several folk that there wasn’t any service. My Claro cellphone had a strong talk signal but the data signal was “E” (not 3G or 4G) and was too weak to be useful. However, the next morning my “T-Mobile One” plan registered 3G and enabled me to do my emails and text my family.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n1. The cafeteria is closed Mon thru Thurs evening. If wishing to camp in the Cancha on these 4 nights, Mary said to ask for a guy called Anibal Buñay. He is normally round and about the Cancha. Say that Mary said to contact him for permission to camp inside.\r\n\r\n2. There is apparently a community hall (sala communal) in Ducur. One could seek out the guy in charge, Martin Vermeo, and ask to camp there. Several folk said he would give permission. He is a member of the “Junta Parrochial”. We looked for him but he wasn’t around.","location":{"latitude":-2.4617,"longitude":-79.11486},"category":{"name":"Informal Campsite"}},{"id":88412,"name":"Hotel Samara Huasi, Suscal.","date_verified":"2019-09-16T19:36:55.000Z","description":"I spent 1 night here while on a solo bike tour.

WiFi is available near the house at the top of the property. There are 3 friendly little dogs. Don’t leave anything laying around or it will become their toy. There is bus service that goes by the property or there are plenty of taxis at the bottom of the hill. It’s about a 20 minute walk down. The view here is great!

And the rest of the year 10 minutes away there are beaches where you can surf.\r\n\r\nAt 20 minutes there is a nice path in the humid forest where you can see howler monkeys.\r\n\r\nTo get here we would like to be notified before. Prices vary according to the season, the number of people and the nights they stay. But they go approximately between 15/22 per person.","location":{"latitude":-0.9956003,"longitude":-80.8571327},"category":{"name":"Hotel"}},{"id":108526,"name":"Estación de bomberos","date_verified":"2023-03-04T14:46:46.000Z","description":"We grabbed the night of the road to El Coca, and we asked in this bomber station if we could pass the night and watched us say so.\r\nQuiet area al costado de la ruta. --- Nos agarró la noche de camino a El Coca, y preguntamos en esta estación de bomberos si podríamos pasar la noche y enseguida nos dijeron que si.\r\nZona tranquila al costado de la ruta.","location":{"latitude":0.06481771823024826,"longitude":-76.88477760187992},"category":{"name":"Informal Campsite"}},{"id":108558,"name":"Ride - moto and bike accessories shop","date_verified":"2019-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","description":"ok selection of stuff here but it's expensive.

José is working hard to protect this important forest and to fight against large mining projects. All support is welcome!\r\n\r\nTo get there you need to make your way to the nearest town Chontal. Either leave you vehicle there and get a mototaxi or collectivo to the trailhead, or to a small house at the trailhead (small vehicles only, ask the family here if it's possible to park and pay them something for the duration.

It takes about 20 minutes on unpaved (but hard) road suitable for non-4x4's. There's a big park a bit further, but gringo's are apparently not allowed past the gate, the guard was very friendly though, and so was his cute little dog . Some locals passed by and were interested in the van, and it all felt very safe.\r\n\r\nMaybe it would be nice for a 4x4 to check it out, since you have an easy access to the beach and can drive along it for miles - locals with bikes and jeeps did so. So camping right on the beach a bit furter away instead of on the parking should be possible. There's zero amenities here, but you're parked right at the beach so who needs those anyway.

There's space for multiple cars past and on the volleybal and football fields. Big rigs may have difficulties in turning around. There's no amenities but you're allowed to use the toilet and bucket shower of the tienda for free (very basic). We watched the children playing volleyball in the evening while the others were bbqing, great atmosphere and nice talks (despite our very very basic spanish). The people of the town would love to welcome more overlanders... so if you're looking for a nice place to spend a night on your way from Quito to the coast or vice versa, this is a good option and you'd make a lot of people happy. \r\nThere's a waterfall in 10 min walking distance.

Start as early as you can to get the views without cloud. We started at 6:30 and were at the top at 9am (average pace) and we got lucky with 5 minutes of clear view.\r\n\r\nSo starting on the trail around the Laguna Limpiopungo, going anticlockwise, after the second hut, you will pass a wooden brigde. This bridge crosses a small creak, and this creak flows following a valley. 10 Meters after the bridge on the right start a trail going up the valley. The first part of the trail is not well defined but you should keep going. This trail goes up in the valley staying always on the left side of the creek. Follow this trail until you reach almost the base of the volcano Ruminahui. From there the trail is less obvious but if you try to find a path going up the ridge on your left, you will finally reach a well defined (rutted) trail. After one switch back this brings you straight up the ridge to the viewpoint. Enjoy!!!\r\n\r\nPS: in December the creek was flowing well and water was available almost all along the trail.

Unfortunately, he closed his shop and his partner, Alexei opened another one just down the road.  We are extremely grateful for that connection. It’s always stressful to find a good mechanic and uneasy knowing if you can trust them. We had a great first impression of Alexei. He put us at ease assuring us he’d get our truck running well and was very honest and up front about potential costs (high) and time (long). He graciously let us stay in our camper in his secure parking lot while the work was being completed. We realized when he left us keys to his place that he was trusting us, and we trusted him. It was a great mutual relationship, and we only wish we had him work on our truck earlier on our trip! Alexei and Sebastian fixed things that should have been addressed early on (bad spark plugs, dirty fuel injectors, fixed a coolant leak, for example).  They also took apart our gear box and found that the problem was not as serious as suspected and were able to solve it much quicker than expected. Sebastian even came in on a Saturday to finish our truck so that we could get out exploring for the weekend. They trusted us to take off with our truck without paying, to return on Monday and settle up. We can’t say enough about how great this meeting was, and how thankful we are to have found Alexei and Sebastian. We recommend them very highly.

Might be different depending on weather conditions, I suppose it could be both much easier or impassable.\r\n\r\nOne nasty thing is also that the river looks much shallower than it is, probably because heavy construction trucks use the river crossing as well, so best to walk it before driving (don't get washed away if you try, use sticks or a rope for security!).\r\n\r\nRegarding the pictures and water marks on our truck: our wheels are 95cm/37inch and we're almost covered, so the deepest point was somewhere around that.","location":{"latitude":-3.31987,"longitude":-79.29771},"category":{"name":"Warning"}},{"id":195314,"name":"potrero de la tienda","date_verified":"2022-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","description":"We stayed one night.

The first operator (after Santa Cruz and Isabela flops) who didn’t lie or make things up just to get you in their boat. And everything, every little detail, that Fabrizio mentioned or previewed was there.\r\n1/ organization: they are super organized. Before your tour, you get a numbered bag where you put your fins, mask and wetsuit. You always get the things that fit and don’t have to worry that you get was is left for you on the boat. It doesn’t get mixed up on board. They leave on time. Like one minute early, unbelievable in SA. \r\n2/ boat: the 360 tour boat is important because you spend a lot of time on it, like 4-5hours maybe. The Hammerhead boat is bigger, which means different options where to sit. Two cushioned benches inside ofc but also plenty of space in the back outside, if you are seasick as I am or if everyone gets out to watch the wildlife(birds, dolphins). Also at the top near the Capitan or in the front. Every time you get out of water there is something tasty waiting for you (water makes everyone hungry) - bananas, watermelon, pineapple, nachos with the best guacamole ever, sweets,…the lunch is also really good and enough. \r\n3/ staff: in the agency you meet Fabrizio, who will be you guide, in person. You can see that he is super friendly, not making awkward forced jokes (we don’t like the comedian-type guides), knowledgeable and he speaks very good English. Btw the sailor on board also spoke English, which was surprising and helpful. \r\n4/ details: Fab really cares about them to make the most of your trip. He is a freediver and carries his GoPro. So, 1/ his videos are amazing as he dives really close to the all wildlife and 2/ you don’t have to worry about spending half of your snorkeling time trying to get the right shot and staring the your screen-you can just enjoy the moment, he shares all his videos/pics in HQ. He brings Vaseline for the guys with moustache, it really works in the mask! He has seasickness pills. There is morning coffee. He previews everything enough in advance so you know what to bring or what you will do at the stop and no one is confused (silly, but apparently not an obvious thing). He studied biology so he knows so much about the wildlife and explains it all. \r\nWe can’t recommend enough. Worth every dollar. Btw, 170$. And, adding all the amazing wildlife you see, our 360 was the best\r\nCheck their online reviews if you want!

Also the brunch menu is served until 1:00 p.m., and then after that they have a good selection of burgers, sandwiches, pastas, and a large dessert menu.  There are two other locations of this chain in the city, but we prefer this one as it has a large parking lot that could accommodate any Overland vehicle.  The parking lot does get very crowded on the weekends, but during the week it was quiet during the times we visited which were mid morning.  We ended up going a few times and every time the quality of the food was excellent and the service was very prompt.
