The sad thing is, even after yesterday, many people will still deny the existence of white privilege.

And as someone who doesn't live in the USA, I will hear a lot of “it doesn't happen here”.

You should read the book “White Fragility” by Robin DiAngelo. I would even say that you should shut the crap up as long as you haven't read that book.
