“Agent Orange will win.”

I wish I posted that in 2016. I wasn't surprised when he did.

When people don't take something seriously, they fail. In 2016, his candidacy wasn't taken seriously, so the population failed.

In 2020, COVID-19 wasn't taken seriously early enough, so the human world failed.

“Human world”. That's important, because the world is actually thriving.
