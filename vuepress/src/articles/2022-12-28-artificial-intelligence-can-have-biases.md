Beware of biases from artificial intelligence, because it is an intelligence. As such, it has biases that likely come from its “parents” (creators) and from what it has been exposed to.

I asked it to make up a short story about phở (Vietnamese soup) and it gave a story with a character named Jake. I asked for another story and the character was Maria. I asked again and the character was Jenny.

Then I added the words “from a Vietnamese person's point of view” and that's when it started using names like Tuan and Tran.

That is what made me think of biases.
