In terms of storytelling, it's basically protagonists trying to survive while villains keep interrupting.

In terms of entertainment, this movie is like watching your friends play the game, then they do an impressive fatality and you go “Holy crap! Daaaamn!”

And they didn't hesitate with the blood, just like the games. However, there were scenes that could have been more disgusting.

Every actor/character is awesome when it comes to fights.
