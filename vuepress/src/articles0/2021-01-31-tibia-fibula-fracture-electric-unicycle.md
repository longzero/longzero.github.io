Week 9 day 2.

A week and a half ago, after seeing me walk with a cane, a friend who has first hand experience of tibia/fibula fracture thought I had the genes of Wolverine.

It is now the beginning of week 9 and I can mount and unmount my electric unicycle without holding on to anything.

However, my ankle can't bend without pain, so my motorcycle boot is quite useful because it limits range of motion and this is great.

If there was less snow and it was warmer right now, I would go practice outside.

It would be great to have the healing factor of Wolverine or Deadpool.
