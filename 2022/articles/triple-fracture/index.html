The adrenaline rush allowed me to crawl from the middle of the street to the sidewalk.</p> <p>Once I was out of the path of cars, the adrenaline went away and I felt the full force of the pain. It was so painful that I wasn't even thinking about asking for help or calling an ambulance.</p> <p>A Good Samaritan who drove by stopped his car to check on me and he called the ambulance. It felt like an eternity before the arrival of the ambulance. It also felt like an eternity before getting to the hospital. In actuality, I was at the hospital an hour later.</p> <h3 id="at-the-hospital"><a href="#at-the-hospital" class="header-anchor">#</a> At the hospital</h3> <p>At the hospital, I was treated like a trauma case, possibly because of the intense pain and also because I was on the verge of an open fracture.</p> <p>They gave me strong painkillers and while I was being pushed on a stretcher to get an X-ray and an MRI, I was looking at the ceiling lights passing by and I may have been hallucinating that I was in a galaxy far far away. I was thinking that I would end up with a bionic leg the same way Luke Skywalker had a bionic hand. It was surprisingly a comforting thought.</p> <p>I also thought those lights on the ceiling were part of a transition into the afterlife, which wasn't as comforting.</p> <p>Eventually, I was moved to a room.</p> <h3 id="the-surgery"><a href="#the-surgery" class="header-anchor">#</a> The surgery</h3> <p>The next day, Sunday, a nurse checked on me. I already deduced that I would need surgery. That much was obvious. The question was when and unfortunaly, the nurse said she didn't know when it would take place. It could the same day or in the next few days.</p> <p>By a stroke of luck, only a few hours later, I was taken into surgery which was extremely fortunate. I was actually given the option to let my leg heal on its own or do the surgery which involved inserting an intramedullary nail into my tibia to stabilize it.</p> <p>I chose the surgery. It was choosing between 2-3 months to heal vs 6 months, so the choice was easy.</p> <p>The procedure went very well according to the surgeon and I was going to be discharged as soon as I could walk with crutches and he expected me to be able to do that within 24 hours, but it wasn't until 48 hours later, on Tuesday, that I was able to “walk”.</p> <p>This video is a one-minute animation of the surgery which took 2.5 hours.</p> <div class="video-wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BNqd_-xDM6A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div> <h3 id="home"><a href="#home" class="header-anchor">#</a> Home</h3> <p>Things like fractures will reveal things that aren't very apparent otherwise, such as what muscles you use when making certain movements.</p> <p>This situation also revealed which areas of my house are the most important on a usefulness level: bathroom, kitchen and bedroom.</p> <p>With that in mind, mutiple changes had to be done at home to make my place handicap friendly.

The worst thing at this point is getting out of bed.</p> <p>When you have an injury such as a fracture in the lower body, one of the things to do is to keep your leg elevated by putting one of more pillows. This is mainly to prevent swelling or rather to reduce it, because at this stage, the swelling seems inevitable.</p> <p>What makes getting out of bed so bad is the blood rush that goes into the leg when it gets down from the bed, or from any place where it is elevated.</p> <p>This pain will continue until week 4.</p> <h2 id="week-3-stitches-removal-and-surprise-walking"><a href="#week-3-stitches-removal-and-surprise-walking" class="header-anchor">#</a> Week 3: Stitches removal and surprise walking</h2> <p>I had an appointment to remove my stitches.</p> <p>The great thing about having an intramedullary nail is that a cast is optional. In addition, you can put weight on your leg as long as the pain is tolerable. This makes wearing a walking boot rather comfortable.</p> <p>However, thus far, the swelling prevented my leg from fitting into the boot until this week.</p> <p>I was able to take a step further and walk with a cane and even take a few steps without it. Even if I could only keep this up for only a few steps, this was an incredible surprise.</p> <div class="video-wrapper"><iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?height=314&amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flongzero%2Fvideos%2F580520176971%2F&amp;show_text=false&amp;width=560" width="560" height="314" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowFullScreen="true" style="border:none;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div> <p>In the same week, I took it even further and tried to ride my electric unicycle in the house and this is what it looks like.</p> <div class="video-wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ygXCzpQ8Hs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div> <h2 id="week-4-5-6-the-end-of-blood-rush-pain-and-transitioning-to-a-cane"><a href="#week-4-5-6-the-end-of-blood-rush-pain-and-transitioning-to-a-cane" class="header-anchor">#</a> Week 4-5-6: The end of blood rush pain and transitioning to a cane</h2> <p>The blood rush from getting out of bed started to go away and I transitioned from using crutches to using a cane.</p> <h2 id="week-7-100-cane"><a href="#week-7-100-cane" class="header-anchor">#</a> Week 7: 100% cane</h2> <p>I had a follow-up appointment at the hospital and I was able to drive myself, a car with manual transmission which means having to use both legs.

fully back even though things like jumping still hurts.</p> <p>For about 3-4 weeks, I've been trying to ride my electric unicycle inside the house and this week, I finally had enough confidence in the healing process to ride outside. I had to be careful not to ride on ice, so I was pretty slow.</p> <p>My ankle still can't fully flex and I have a feeling it will remain the case for much of 2021.
