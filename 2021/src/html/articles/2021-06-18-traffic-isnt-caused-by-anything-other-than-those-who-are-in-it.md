I encourage you to remember when you were a younger person before you could drive a car, remember how you went from one place to another.

My hope is that you realize you never needed a car and you don't need one now, at least not every day; not even most days.

Traffic isn't caused by anything other than those who are in it. If you go to the Old Port tonight with your car, you are a fool.

By the way, I am talking about all traffic, because bicycle traffic is very real and I reiterate: traffic isn't caused by anything other than those who are in it.

When you were a kid, you experienced traffic only when adults put you in their cars.

Before you started driving, going from your bed to see friends was effortless and you were free of road rage, no matter how long it took to see your friends. Remember that.

Somewhere along the way, while you were growing, you decided to throw that effortlessness away, for no good reason.

I know your reasons and none of them are good.

Traffic isn't caused by anything other than those who are in it.
