The adrenaline rush allowed me to crawl from the middle of the street to the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>Once I was out of the path of cars, the adrenaline went away and I felt the full force of the pain. It was so painful that I wasn’t even thinking about asking for help or calling an ambulance.</p>\n<p>A Good Samaritan who drove by stopped his car to check on me and he called the ambulance. It felt like an eternity before the arrival of the ambulance. It also felt like an eternity before getting to the hospital. In actuality, I was at the hospital an hour later.</p>\n<h3 id=\"at-the-hospital\">At the hospital</h3>\n<p>At the hospital, I was treated like a trauma case, possibly because of the intense pain and also because I was on the verge of an open fracture.</p>\n<p>They gave me strong painkillers and while I was being pushed on a stretcher to get an X-ray and an MRI, I was looking at the ceiling lights passing by and I may have been hallucinating that I was in a galaxy far far away. I was thinking that I would end up with a bionic leg the same way Luke Skywalker had a bionic hand. It was surprisingly a comforting thought.</p>\n<p>I also thought those lights on the ceiling were part of a transition into the afterlife, which wasn’t as comforting.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I was moved to a room.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-surgery\">The surgery</h3>\n<p>The next day, Sunday, a nurse checked on me. I already deduced that I would need surgery. That much was obvious. The question was when and unfortunaly, the nurse said she didn’t know when it would take place. It could the same day or in the next few days.</p>\n<p>By a stroke of luck, only a few hours later, I was taken into surgery which was extremely fortunate. I was actually given the option to let my leg heal on its own or do the surgery which involved inserting an intramedullary nail into my tibia to stabilize it.</p>\n<p>I chose the surgery. It was choosing between 2-3 months to heal vs 6 months, so the choice was easy.</p>\n<p>The procedure went very well according to the surgeon and I was going to be discharged as soon as I could walk with crutches and he expected me to be able to do that within 24 hours, but it wasn’t until 48 hours later, on Tuesday, that I was able to “walk”.</p>\n<p>This video is a one-minute animation of the surgery which took 2.5 hours.</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BNqd_-xDM6A\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"home\">Home</h3>\n<p>Things like fractures will reveal things that aren’t very apparent otherwise, such as what muscles you use when making certain movements.</p>\n<p>This situation also revealed which areas of my house are the most important on a usefulness level: bathroom, kitchen and bedroom.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, mutiple changes had to be done at home to make my place handicap friendly. This meant putting everything I use most to those places for easy access.</p>\n<h2 id=\"week-2-blood-rush-pain\">Week 2: Blood rush pain</h2>\n<p>No change. The worst thing at this point is getting out of bed.</p>\n<p>When you have an injury such as a fracture in the lower body, one of the things to do is to keep your leg elevated by putting one of more pillows. This is mainly to prevent swelling or rather to reduce it, because at this stage, the swelling seems inevitable.</p>\n<p>What makes getting out of bed so bad is the blood rush that goes into the leg when it gets down from the bed, or from any place where it is elevated.</p>\n<p>This pain will continue until week 4.</p>\n<h2 id=\"week-3-stitches-removal-and-surprise-walking\">Week 3: Stitches removal and surprise walking</h2>\n<p>I had an appointment to remove my stitches.</p>\n<p>The great thing about having an intramedullary nail is that a cast is optional. In addition, you can put weight on your leg as long as the pain is tolerable. This makes wearing a walking boot rather comfortable.</p>\n<p>However, thus far, the swelling prevented my leg from fitting into the boot until this week.</p>\n<p>I was able to take a step further and walk with a cane and even take a few steps without it. Even if I could only keep this up for only a few steps, this was an incredible surprise.</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\">\n<!-- https://www.facebook.com/122000162/videos/a.574422401961/580520176971 -->\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?height=314&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flongzero%2Fvideos%2F580520176971%2F&show_text=false&width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowFullScreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<p>In the same week, I took it even further and tried to ride my electric unicycle in the house and this is what it looks like.</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ygXCzpQ8Hs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"week-4-5-6-the-end-of-blood-rush-pain-and-transitioning-to-a-cane\">Week 4-5-6: The end of blood rush pain and transitioning to a cane</h2>\n<p>The blood rush from getting out of bed started to go away and I transitioned from using crutches to using a cane.</p>\n<h2 id=\"week-7-100-cane\">Week 7: 100% cane</h2>\n<p>I had a follow-up appointment at the hospital and I was able to drive myself, a car with manual transmission which means having to use both legs.

This is a personal story for people who feel like they are in a craphole and they want to get out of it, but don’t know how. This is the way I did it.</p>\n<p>2013 was the worst year of my life. Towards the end, I had trouble looking for a job I wanted to make websites, but I also needed to do something to make money. I became a delivery boy for a private delivery company and decided to look for a job I really wanted in the evening after work.</p>\n<p>The pay was one of the worst pay in my life. I didn’t like the job. I worked long hours and it drained a ton of energy out of me. I was a monster on the road. It drained so much energy that I wasn’t even looking for a job after work.</p>\n<p>Two months later, I got in my car for another workday and looked at myself in the mirror and said: “You’re a fucking idiot! You’re never going to make websites again and learn anything new if you stay on this path!”</p>\n<p>Right then and there, I was totally disgusted with what the mirror was showing me, so I called my boss and quit.</p>\n<p>I knew there was only one way for me to get back on the right path: I had to ignore conventional wisdom: “Don’t put all of your eggs in one basket.” So I proceeded to put all of my eggs in one basket. It was either: get a job making websites or die. It was that simple. During those two months of deliveries, I was destroying my soul without realizing it.</p>\n<p>I was single, with no kids and my entourage was healthy. The most important things in my life were covered, so ultimately, there was no reason for me to deviate from the path I needed to be on.</p>\n<p>After that, it took two to three months to finally get a job that made sense, a job I could use as a foundation for things to come.</p>\n<p>The lesson of my story is the opposite of what so many people say: Put all of your eggs in one basket. No one foot on one side and the other foot on the other side. No distraction. No hesitation. No playing safe, because ironically, it’s insanely dangerous to scatter your eggs all over the place. You can’t claim to have done your best if you didn’t put in everything you’ve got, if you didn’t put in maximum effort.</p>\n<p>Whatever you do, whether you’re playing music, building your career, building your company, maintaining your relationships, parenting your kids, trying to keep your partner happy, etc, just go all in. Don’t hold back.</p>\n<p>Just go all in.</p>\n","updatedAt":"2021-12-30T04:54:50.786Z"},"amazing-life-2018-year-amazement":{"title":"Amazing life - 2018, my year of amazement","permalink":"/articles/amazing-life-2018-year-amazement","date":"2018-04-12","postType":"articles","status":1,"author":"Long","image":"amazing-life-2018-year-amazement.jpg","pageClass":"article","type":"post","tags":["Well-being"],"body":"<p>Very often this year, I’ve found myself noticing how amazing my life it.

The news always approaches the topic from the same angle: “This person was charged with sexual assault” and “That person was charged with sexual assault”. It never educates. Some men are just oblivious about what they’re doing. The conversation should go beyond what’s in the news.</p>\n<p>What’s beyond? That’s obvious: actions.</p>\n<p>Personally, when I see something wrong online, I point it out. My latest move was to leave a comment “That’s sexist”. That’s all I do online though. Inevitably, when someone online gets called out about sexism (or anything else), you receive comments that you’re a troll or you need to relax because it’s a “joke” or people just report your account. I don’t respond to that. I have no interest in arguing online, so I see this action of calling out akin to planting a seed with the hope that the person will think about it and/or one day, the person will get a wake up call and remember that comment I posted.</p>\n<p>In real life, the action I would like to activate is to punch every offender in the face, including family and friends. In fact, I would go harder on family and friends.</p>\n<p>Obviously, I don’t encourage anybody to punch anybody. The furthest I’ve gone, physically, was to shove someone against the wall because he kept harassing a girl who kept having to say no. In retrospect, I should have started with words: “Hey, stop it. She said no, a million times. What you’re doing is sexual harassment.”</p>\n<p>Words… That’s the action we should all take. Start with calling out sexual harassment and all the bullcrap you witness. I see this action as picking up a piece of trash in a park and putting it in the garbage bin that happens to be just next to it.</p>\n<p>I was going to end with that paragraph, but I want to mention the fear of taking action because of consequences. With regard to this topic, I have two fears.</p>\n<p>I do have a lot of fear when I stand up to people who can basically knock me out with one punch. It’s terrifying, but sexual harassment is an issue that is way bigger than me, so I tell myself not to let fear stop me from doing the right thing.</p>\n<p>The other fear I have is misstepping and facing consequences of doing the right thing. In my head, this is worse than getting beat up. Sometimes, helping can make a situation worse and I fear that. I can’t see any obvious way to go around this fear, except by paying attention, being aware of the matter and listening, especially when you’re told you’re wrong.</p>\n<p>Issues that are bigger than any one of us, like sexual harassment, can get very confusing, so listening is key, even to conflicting information.</p>\n<p>“This is confusing. Is it sexist to hit you? Is it more sexist to not hit you? I mean the line is real blurry.” ~Deadpool</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\">\n  <iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jqtw7WJPrjg?start=17&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<p>I am scared as fuck to post this and I am way out of my comfort zone, but like I said, this is way bigger than me.</p>\n<p>Nothing that matters is easy.</p>\n<p>What I hope anybody takes away from this post: take action and do something about it.</p>\n","updatedAt":"2021-12-30T04:55:04.924Z"},"chaos-in-the-streets-vietnam-traffic":{"title":"Chaos in the streets","permalink":"/articles/chaos-in-the-streets-vietnam-traffic","date":"2018-08-05","postType":"articles","status":1,"author":"Long","image":"chaos-in-the-streets-vietnam-traffic.jpg","pageClass":"article","type":"post","tags":["Travel","Vietnam"],"body":"<p>Being in Vietnam makes me realize something I miss dearly: Chaos in the streets.</p>\n<p>What I mean by that is people jaywalking all over the place and drivers of all sorts of vehicles swifting through the streets.</p>\n<p>In chaos, honking means “be careful”.

Namely, trafic, parking, licence, gas; those are things that end up taking a big part of your life when you use a car.</p>\n<p>Why an electric unicycle over other electric vehicles?

The instagram post is linked at the end.</p>\n<p>One of the things I’ve started doing two weeks ago was to play Tetris with my life and time. It means I’ve started scheduling everything, including my sleep, and I’ve effectively killed my to-do list.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with the to-do list. Do you have one? Look at it. Look at all the crap you should have done weeks ago or months ago, but you haven’t touched. Their existence is proof that you suck at doing things you set your mind to. Cross all those off, because if you’ve waited that long, they can’t be important enough to keep around.</p>\n<p>Next, let’s talk about sleep and scheduling everything and playing Tetris. I’ve come to see everything I do and have to do as Tetris blocks and my entire life is the Tetris board and when I die, it means I have more than I can handle and that’s game over.</p>\n<p>Tetris blocks represent things that need to be done. You know how Tetris works: every single block has to fit somewhere and you have to clear lines, as in get things done, otherwise, you’re dead.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, it makes total sense to schedule sleep as well as everything else, like time to hang out with friends and time to spend with family.</p>\n<p>Let’s go back to the to-do list. I don’t have one anymore. Now, when you ask me to do something, I put it in my calendar. I effectively make time for it; I, you, and others, know when it will happen, unlike with a to-do list where you just write down things, but you have no clue when you’ll get to it and get it done, if it’s going to get done at all.</p>\n<p>Then some people tell me that by scheduling/planning everything, I don’t leave room for the unexpected and spontaneity. To that, I guarantee (I don’t do that a lot) that no matter how hard you plan, surprise will find you, whether it’s good or bad. It’s a human world after all.</p>\n<p>Serendipity: my schedule deviates on a weekly basis, but back to the Tetris game, deviating is the equivalent of misplacing blocks, either on purpose or by accident. What you have to do is readjust and get back on track or… Game over.</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\">\n  <iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GiUdZ9U-2q4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay;

His name was Maurice. He seemed to be carrying absolutely all his books. I told myself that he must be an idiot to carry all that, especially on a Friday.</p>\n<p>I didn’t think much of it, so I minded my business, then I saw a bunch of kids run towards Maurice. They dropped all his books, made him fall and lose his glasses. While he was standing up, I could see sadness in his eyes. My heart was breaking.</p>\n<p>I ran towards him. While helping him get his glasses and books, I saw a drop of tear on his cheek and I told him: “Those guys are jerks. They should be punished for what they did.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you”, he replied, looking at me.</p>\n<p>He had a big smile on his face, full of sincere gratitude.</p>\n<p>I asked where he lived and realized that we were on the same street. I asked why I never saw him before and he answered: “Before, I went to a private school.”</p>\n<p>Before this, I would never have hung out with someone from a private school. We talked the whole way home and I carried some of his books. I realized he was a very nice person and I invited him to come play with my friends the next day and he accepted.</p>\n<p>We spent the weekend together. The more I got to know him, the more I liked him and my friends also liked him.</p>\n<p>Monday morning, on the way to school, I saw Maurice with all his books again. I joined him and said: “You’ll have great muscles if you keep carrying all your books every day.”</p>\n<p>He smiled at me and gave me half his books. Maurice and I became the best friends in the world.</p>\n<p>A few years later, we were finishing high school and were making plans for university. Maurice was the best student and he was getting into medicine while I was getting into a sports-study program. He was one of those who had found themselves during high school. He had more dates with girls than I did. They liked him and I was a little jealous.</p>\n<p>Prior to leaving, parents, teachers, students and friends were gathering. He had prepared a speech, but he was very nervous. I gave him a pat on the back to encourage him and said: “Hey, you’ll be great!”</p>\n<p>He gave me a sincere look and said: “Thanks!”</p>\n<p>He began his speech: “This is a good time to be grateful to those who helped us go through difficult moments: parents, teachers, etc and especially friends. I am here to tell you that to be someone’s friends is to give a person the best possible gift. Let me tell you a story about this.”</p>\n<p>I looked at Maurice, stupefied, when he recounted the first day we met. He had planned to commit suicide that weekend. He had emptied his locker, because he didn’t want his mother to have to do it. He looked at me straight in the eyes and smiled: “Thank you for saving me. My friend protected me and kept me from making an enormous mistake.”</p>\n<p>Everybody was speechless while Maurice, the most handsome and most popular guy in school, was talking about his saddest memories. I noticed his parents looking at me with the same grateful smile Maurice had. In that moment, I realized all the sadness he felt the day we met. It wasn’t only because of that bunch of kids.</p>\n<p>Don’t underestimate the power of your actions. With one small gesture, you can change a life, for better or for worse. Friends are angels that keep us on our feet when we have trouble flying with our wings.</p>\n<p>-Anonymous</p>\n","updatedAt":"2021-12-30T04:56:42.471Z"},"opening-hours-of-social-media":{"title":"Opening hours of social media","permalink":"/articles/opening-hours-of-social-media","date":"2013-09-07","postType":"articles","status":1,"author":"Long","image":"opening-hours-of-social-media.jpg","pageClass":"article","type":"post","tags":["Culture","Technology"],"body":"<p>Last week, news came out that a man spent $1000 on Twitter’s ad platform to complain about British Airways.

I guess I just want to keep a record of this little episode for myself.</p>\n<p>Read <a href=\"/articles/rebekkas-website-the-design-2-of-2/\">Rebekka’s website, the design (2 of 2)</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.rebekkagudleifs.com/\">Rebekka’s website</a></p>\n","updatedAt":"2021-12-30T04:56:59.843Z"},"rebekkas-website-the-design-2-of-2":{"title":"Rebekka’s website, the design (2 of 2)","permalink":"/articles/rebekkas-website-the-design-2-of-2","date":"2006-10-17","postType":"articles","status":1,"author":"Long","image":"rebekkas-website-the-design-2-of-2.jpg","pageClass":"article","type":"post","tags":["Web design and development"],"body":"<p>The <a href=\"/articles/rebekkas-website-the-beginnings-1-of-2/\">first post</a> I made on this subject was about everything that occurred before I started working on <a href=\"http://www.rebekkagudleifs.com/\">Rebekka’s website</a>. This one will be about how I ended up making the website the way it is.</p>\n<p>“if i have a site done i want it to be very simple, user friendly to the point” is what Rebekka told me.</p>\n<p>I have heard the words “simple” and “user friendly” before. My whole life, the way I do things, the way I work, the way I interact, the way I… is all centered around “simple”. The design for my very own website does justice to that.</p>\n<p>I have never been told “to the point” before. What that meant to me, web design-wise, is no useless flash animation with a very useful skip button. It also meant that the subject of the website should be unmistakable, even with the word “photography” no where to be found on the website.</p>\n<p>Her photos are the most important thing. I started out with one big photo and then I layed out everything else around. The quality of the photos is the only thing that matters. I wanted people to come on the website and say “nice photos” rather than “nice website”. Every single page of the website has the big area for a photo. There are no thumbnails page. By laying out things this way, I believe to have accomplished all three points (simple, user friendly and to the point) of Rebekka’s request.</p>\n<p>“One thing i hate about my flickr page is the white background. Just not a good way to display photos.”</p>\n<p>She didn’t like the white background on flickr, so I went to the other extreme: black background. Just as simple as that.</p>\n<p>“i’m very pleased with the colors (the green is just perfect, that color is just me in a nutshell:p)”</p>\n<p>The text color is gray rather than white for the simple reason that I wanted to reduce the contrast so that the photos always stand out. About the greenish color, I got it from her signature on her <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/rebba/32296282/\">most favorited photo</a> (at this time). Rebekka didn’t tell me to do it, but since she used that color for her signature, it just made sense to me to use it.</p>\n<p>“i’m very happy with the site”</p>\n<p>I’m also very happy with the site. If I had to describe this website in one sentence, I would say that it’s simple, user friendly and to the point.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.rebekkagudleifs.com/\">Rebekka’s website</a></p>\n","updatedAt":"2021-12-30T04:57:05.439Z"},"respect-happiness-is-contagious":{"title":"Respect + Happiness is contagious","permalink":"/articles/respect-happiness-is-contagious","date":"2019-06-24","postType":"articles","status":1,"author":"Long","pageClass":"article","type":"post","tags":["Well-being"],"body":"<p>I’ve been going out, at least once a week, to bars and restaurants (80% bars) since 2011.
