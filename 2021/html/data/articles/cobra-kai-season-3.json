I binged-watched it and it turned out to be a great way to start the year.</p>\n<p>This season made much more sense to me than season 2 in which I thought fights started for no good reason at all. Fights make more sense in season 3 and the storyline does as well.</p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\">\n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LcDQqGJG8pA\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<p>The season starts where the previous season left off; it is the aftermath of the school fight and the rest develops from there. It gets better and better from episode to episode and I absolutely love the return of an old character from the Karate Kid movies.</p>\n<p>I really love how season 3 ended with the Christmas music during one of the fight scene as well as Phil Collinsâ€™s In the Air Tonight.</p>\n<p>I definitely recommend Cobra Kai 3.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/articles/cobra-kai-season-3-poster.jpg\" alt=\"Part of the homepage of longzero.com on 2020-12-30\"></p>\n","updatedAt":"2021-01-04T20:19:32.000Z"}
