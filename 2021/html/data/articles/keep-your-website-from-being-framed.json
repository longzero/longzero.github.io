It can also mess up the URL and screw up bookmarks and link-sharing. I don’t want to dwell too much on why frames are bad, but I want to show you a way to free your website in case it ends up being in somebody’s frame.</p>\n<p>All you need is a small piece of JavaScript in the &lt;head&gt; section of your HTML code.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n  if (top != self) top.location.href = self.location.href\n&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>With this, when a website decides to put your website in a frame, your website will be able to break free and your URL will show up in the address bar as it should.</p>\n","updatedAt":"2021-12-30T04:56:14.776Z"}
