It used to be called AAAAAHHHH.
Then it became Boycotting.
Then it became Cancelling.
The next letter is D...
Maybe the next word will be... Dropping?

Then Eliminating.
Then Fuck it/them/him/her.

It's all the same crap. So many people talk about cancel culture like it was created in this century.

The idea behind the word “woke” isn't new either. None of this is new.

It's like painting an old house and it can look worse or better, but it's still the same house with all the same foundation problems.
