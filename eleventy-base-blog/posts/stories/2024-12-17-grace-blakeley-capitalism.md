Capitalism doesn't care about people. Capitalism doesn't care about the environment.
“[...] what we have are basically large powerful corporations working together with financial institutions, with very powerful governments to protect to protect their own interests and their wealth and power at the expense of the public interest. That is <strong><em>not</em></strong> a free market democratic system, that is an oligarchic centralized system based on, effectively, what in any other nation we would call corruption.”
