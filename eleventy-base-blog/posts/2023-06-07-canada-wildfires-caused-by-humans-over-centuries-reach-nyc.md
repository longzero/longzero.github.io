The crazy thing about wildfires isn't how big they are, how frequently they show up, how early they show up, how many there are or how far they reach.

The crazy thing about wildfires is that despite all aspects getting more and more intense over time, humans keep behaviours that scientifically make climate change more intense.

Namely, those behaviours are:
- driving cars when you don't have to
- eating meat
- using a drying machine instead of just hanging clothes
- using AC instead of spending time in a forest or a park with shade
- taking a flight instead of driving
- going on cruise ships
- always producing things and buying things nobody needs
- enabling capitalism
- using single-use anything
- many more things I am not thinking about right now

Despite this terrible moment happening right now, affecting millions of people and seen by millions of people, millions of people will still keep behaving like none of it happened.

Even the most affected people with respiratory problems will keep behaving like climate change isn't happening, even though they believe the science.

Nature isn't crazy, humans are.
