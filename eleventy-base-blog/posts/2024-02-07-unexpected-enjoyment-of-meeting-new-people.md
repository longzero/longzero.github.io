Something unexpected is happening in 2024:
I'm meeting new people and I'm enjoying it.

Wanting and enjoying meeting new people has not been a personality trait of mine since 2012.

My enjoyment of 2024 started in January with Vanlife Pride. Those people were damn amazing and that led to an increase of 100 more people I follow on Instagram.

Now, I'm meeting new colleagues virtually and trying to set up in-person meetings in various places in south west USA and I actually look forward to it.

I don't think this rhythm will last for the entirety of 2024, but I'm definitely enjoying this moment.

It's definitely better than 2023's unexpected thing:
Spending a fortune on mechanical issues.
