I watched Clueless (1995) for the first time in my life and less than 10 minutes in, I already loved the movie. I am glad I watched it for the first time as an adult who cares about social issues, because if I saw it as a teenager, I would have dismissed it as just a regular movie.

How is it that almost 30 years after the movie's release, all the social issues addressed in the movie remain barely touched?

Women's rights, feminism, gay rights, diversity, representation, consumerism, fashion, helping others as self-care, self-expression, self-esteem; all topics from the movie.

The movie did make me think of Barbie. I'm guessing a lot of conservatives and centrists didn't like it in 1995.

In this year (2023), Alicia Silverstone took the role again in a Superbowl ad.
