The main difference between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi is the data bandwidth. 5 GHz Wi-Fi offers connection speeds up to about one gigabit, whereas 2.4 GHz connections top out about 300 megabits1. 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi also works better through walls and over long distances than 5 GHz1.

The 2.4 GHz band is a pretty crowded place, because it’s used by more than just Wi-Fi. Old cordless phones, garage door openers, baby monitors, and other devices tend to use the 2.4 GHz band. The longer waves used by the 2.4 GHz band are better suited to longer ranges and transmission through walls and solid objects. So it’s arguably better if you need better range on your devices or you have a lot of walls or other objects in the areas where you need coverage1. However, because so many devices use the 2.4 GHz band, the resulting congestion can cause dropped connections and slower-than-expected speeds1.

The 5 GHz band is much less congested, which means you will likely get more stable connections1. Additionally, 5 GHz Wi-Fi is better at avoiding signal interference from other routers and devices2. This really comes in handy if you’re in an apartment complex or any living situation where you are in range of other routers2.

So, in summary, if you need a faster connection and there are not many walls or other objects blocking the signal, then 5 GHz Wi-Fi is a good choice. If you need a better range or there are many walls or other objects blocking the signal, then 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi is a better choice.
