There is a brown sign that indicates it.  There is going to be a man that stops you for offering you park and tours (he is kind of aggressive with it, pushing the tour on us and that we didn't have other options. That's not true, just say no thanks and keep going down the road until you reach the information wood house on the right). There you have to park and go in the wood house and they will inform you what's the canyon all about and tell you you have 2 options of tours with them, the short one that is 12usd p/p (2 hours) and the 17usd p/p (3hr30min: 4usd for the park entry fee, some for the boat and the rest goes to a cooperative of the guides families). We chose to do it by ourselves even they tried to tell us we couldn't. The long tour is the most amazing one and the better experience of the canyon (a hike, swim through the tall walls of the canyon, then boat and hike back). Again they will make you feel that you have to take the tour but you can do it by yourself (be sure you know how to swim well though). If you pay the tour we recommend a guide that we happen to meet on our solo walk, Teo Flores Figueroa. He was so kind and sweet to us, great heart, giving us free information even when we didn't payed for the tour. Contact him directly if you want (84266408). \nWe only pay the 4usd of park fee and drove the car down the road to the next parking lot (30cordobas to the woman there). Then we walk down to the river and randomly met Teo that recommend us to do it the other way (the long tour). We did and was awesome!! We gave him a money gift just because he was so awesome to us, he never asked for anything and was genuinely surprised when we wanted to give him some money. Anyway, we recommend him specially and the swimming down the canyon is amazing (just beware that is a long swim and you go through a hike before it and on the river there are rocks parts you need to walk through).

You arrive at a small parking where there might be a guardian charging the  entrance fee of 3 US pr person. From here you can walk about 1.5 km to the crater. Great views along the whole trail and also from the parking.Asked guardian. Said you can spend the night. Safe.\r\nWe continued another 10 min along the dirt road which deteriorates and becomes somewhat diffecult. Ends up at a small community where there is a kind of cabana where people visiting the volcano can sleep in hammocks or on mattresses. You can camp there as well. No view but the hike to the volcano and mirador is shorter and easier, about 20-30 min. We spent the night there. Both overnight spots are free. The first parking more quiet. No roosters, dogs etc. \r\nBoth places have very simple toilets.\r\nVolcano and views from volcano towards Volcan Momotombo and San Cristobal fantastic.

The people from the Rescue Station do their best to find the turtles before other locals do. Who take the eggs and sell them as a food delicacy as a mean of income, particularly in the largely impoverished coastal regions.\nRobert, who runs the organization uses his retirement funds to pay his stuff and tries to buy as many eggs he can afford from the locals (for example 100 eggs about 560 NIO).\nWe were also there when a local came by selling the eggs, and we could assist to bury them in a safe and secured nest, where they hatch about 40-50 days later.\n\nThe Sea Turtle Rescue Station doesn't ask for money but donations are highly welcomed. They also sell small plastic turtles. Made by women from the village who use recycled material. One turtle is 5 USD, 1 for the woman and 4 for the organisation.\n\nIt was a breathtaking and amazing experience to see so many different aspects of a turtle rescue and to have the possibility to be involved as much as you want to.\n\nYou can find this place if you walk 150 metres north on the beach from Rancho Tranquillo and look for the small sign \"Sea Turtle Rescue Nicaragua\".

If money is the problem then he decided to buy them and also help the community. \n\nIf you want to have an incredible experience volunteering at sanctuary turtle rescue program helping turtles come into the world with your own hands - because it is part of the rescuing protocol, otherwise they would not be saved, and release them in the sand to make their walk to life through the sand, and then contemplate this unique scenario, you shouldn’t miss this place!! If in the season they release every single day between 200-500 baby turtles. Just keep in mind that the opening of the eggs happens around 1:00pm and the turtles sand release around 5:00pm. Check also with Rachel or Matt from Salt Escapes Lodge if it is the right season. https://www.saltescapesnicaragua.com/ \n\nScott allowed me to park on his property for free right on the beach. Not easy to drive here, not at all! you must really enjoy driving on dirt roads, but it’s worth it! \n\nTo get here from Managua: Drive north towards Leon turn left onto Camino Salinas Grandes about 25 km from Leon or about 7 -10 mins after the highways meet there is an antenna with a movie star logo on the north west corner. Take the road until there is a fork in the road and then stay right. Continue until just after the cemetery on your left , you will see a road called “Los lirios”. Go left onto that and follow till the clearing. Follow the playa Tesoro signs until you reach the blue wall, then go left. The sanctuary is at the house where the wall ends - Tundra Propriety. (DO NOT FOLLOW GOOGLE MAPS - it will take you to a road that actually it is not correct.\n\nIf you do not want to drive through that really tough “Los Lirios” dirt road, another option is to park at Casa de Rigo Sampson and next day you can walk along the sand to the sanctuary, shouldn’t be that far.\n\nEnjoy it!","location":{"latitude":12.242028205666916,"longitude":-86.83216874495784},"category":{"name":"Tourist Attraction"}},{"id":49080,"name":"Mirador Volcan San Cristobal","date_verified":"2017-12-30T03:53:15.923Z","description":"Great view of the Volcano and hiking is available also horse ride to top 6 or 4 hours","location":{"latitude":12.653996666666668,"longitude":-87.00035000000001},"category":{"name":"Tourist Attraction"}},{"id":49081,"name":"Centro turístico Volcán San Cristobal","date_verified":"2018-02-08T19:56:16.487Z","description":"Cabins 10$ per person 5$ to camp.

They wanted you to book a room at approx us$95 and then will charge us$7 per night to park.  The airport itself is really nice and very small.  TONS of souvenirs to buy if you need to (beautifully set out in a market type atmosphere).  There is a departure tax of us$35 but ours was included in our ticket).

My boyfriend insisted we had none while I kept walking. He left. \r\n\r\nA few minutes later the same guy came back with his friend and cornered us in on the boardwalk section. They tried to grab my bag, I resisted as it seemed they were not armed, all 4 of us scuffled and I managed to keep hold of the bag by lying on it. At this point another group of people approached and the guys left, and we ran into town. \r\n\r\nWe went for dinner anyway assuming we'd find a taxi back after. Struggled to find a taxi but fortunately some friends of the Queen Lobster owner offered us a ride. \r\n\r\nTogether with a robbery in Awas too (see entry on there) and some general verbal abuse and bad feelings, we left Pearl Lagoon much sooner than we'd planned.

I made it in a ford E150. a tall van could be an issue as some parts of the track are not level and your vehicle will be tilted.

He thought he had misplaced it, we tried to help him look to no avail. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe then got a notification from our bank saying that transactions were trying to be placed on OUR credit card in Nindiri (20 minute way from Granada). The card was the only one in our security locker when we left to explore and we never use it since it is our back up card. So the card never had an opportunity to be compromised otherwise.

We still had the card but someone obviously got the information they needed off of it. \r\n\r\n\r\nUpon inspection of the locker I noticed that it looks secure but it is not actually bolted to the floor and the back Is open to the wall so all a person has to do to access it is lean it away from the wall like you would moving a bookshelf, and easily reach behind. The morning we left, I noticed a bag of mine was pulled between the wall and the security locker so someone had leaned the locker again and tried to get something once more. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe contacted our bank, got the transaction canceled, and packed up and left. We did not talk to the staff about this, they were extremely unhelpful with our hostel room mate frantic requests for assistance and we feel this must be staff or regular contractors doing the theft since the hostel had very few guests, no one else in our room, and the security lockers are only compromised with intimate knowledge of their design. \r\n\r\n$10 pp for basic dorm.
