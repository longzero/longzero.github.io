Beck Falls are maybe the nicest, excellent swimming. Then another 15min to Big Drop Waterfall turnoff (good trail). From this turnoff it is 20min on a extremely steep trail (ropes provided) to Big Drop Fall (swimming difficult). You have to descend 190 altimeters! 20min backtracking to the turnoff. From turnoff (good former logging trail) 1:35min to Park entrance. (On the way you can walk down to an old steam hoist, it is only 170mts). Total walking time: 4:50hrs\n\nWe recommend to hike the other way round because you start with the hard bit and finish with a swimm in Bojawina falls.

You can extend visa here but NOT a vehicle permit. If you must go here make an appointment; as a walk in you have to line up at 6am to put your name on a list at 7am. We were #20 and it took 8 hours of waiting in the parking lot. Vehicle permits can only be done at a border and is quick and easy.

There is now a very large flat area suitable and open for camping. There is municipal water from the hose bib. Good little bar/restaurant and bathrooms on site, no showers except your hose. If you’re lucky you will see a crocodile in the river, on that note, NO swimming. We thoroughly  enjoyed our stay, loved the people and will return if we come back this way.

Park just before the bridge that crosses the river. There will be sign that says “Hokeb Ha Cave” and the trail starts just behind the sign and to the left. Easy to follow for most of the hike until you get past the eco-lodges and get to the river crossing. It will seem like the trail disappears, but if you look directly across the river (I was there in the dry season so it was just rocks), just to the right of a clearing that leads to the river, you should see where it continues. Follow the trail up the right side river bank for a short distance and you will see an enormous cave opening. Wonderful swimming inside and outside the caves, and I even brought my snorkeling mask to look at the fish in the beautiful blue water. Took about 30 minutes to get there and 20 on the way back down. NOTE: if you have children or pets keep your eyes on them at ALL times. There are two small whirlpools (one inside the cave, and one outside of it) that suck water down below the surface. Not dangerous at all if you’re paying attention as they are disconnected from the swimming areas, but it would worry me if I had children or pets with me.","location":{"latitude":16.200814,"longitude":-89.0456164},"category":{"name":"Tourist Attraction"}},{"id":267745,"name":"Silver Sand Hostel","date_verified":"2024-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"This is a brand-new Hostel, they opened just a few weeks ago.
