It crosses a river (quite shallow in dry season) and heads towards the beach through the forest, where you can see monkeys from time to time. The track then continues for about 2.5km directly on the beach - I suppose this is only possible at low tide. Along the way you'll find several openings in the forest that you can access for boondocking, one is also on iOverlander. Later the track returns to land, goes through Manzanillo and then you can follow it further along the coast line to Hermosa - again with several spots for boondocking. The track isn't difficult at all, it's just lovely,  but because of the part on the beach I'd say it's 4WD - only.

As you exit Nicaragua, pass the line of trucks. It is very narrow so try to find your way carefully.\r\n\r\n2. There is an office of immigration for trucks. They don't do tourists. You need to wait for the truck before you pass and you go through fumigation.\r\n\r\n3. As you exit fumigation, keep to your right. Soon you will see the immigration offices. Park wherever you can.\r\n\r\n4. Stamp your passport. This can be a 5-minute or a 45-minute process depending on if there were some buses of people before you. Super friendly immigration officers. \r\n\r\n5. Right across the street there is where you get a form for TIP. You fill out the form, the officer signs it. You also get paper ticket with your vehicle registration number.  With this form, you walk or drive 100 meters further. \r\n\r\n6. There is a modern building with security in front of it where you can get insurance ($56 or the equivalent in colon, no credit card) and your TIP.\r\n\r\n7. As you exit the border area, you need to give them a paper ticket with your vehicle registration number. \r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\n1) You don't need copies of any documents. You don't need to pay any fees (apart from mandatory insurance).\r\n2) Many travelers report that insurance purchased in Guatemala that should cover Costa Rica is not accepted.\r\n","location":{"latitude":11.21286,"longitude":-85.61197},"category":{"name":"Customs and Immigration"}},{"id":54130,"name":"irdama","date_verified":"2018-03-09T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Nice hostel with clean rooms and hot showers.

Las Catalinas has public outdoor showers by the beach and public restrooms. Pura Vida Ride bike shop was really helpful too, would suggest stopping by for bike rentals or whatever you need.

There are walking poles, which I highly recommend to use. If you like, you can swim in the waterfall, but it's really cold.

The place is on the left side about 150m along the road as you take the right fork as you enter the main part of Dos Brazos (ie at the school and pulpería). If you get to the first segmented concrete bridge, you've gone too far, the place is immediately before this bridge. I included a picture of the house from the entrance. \r\n\r\nLigia offers camping and parking with an out-building that has a toilet and showers (it used to be the El Tigre pulpería).  Ligia and her husband Wilner are both very friendly and welcoming. They have a dog, Tigre, who is very relaxed. \r\n\r\nThe house is right next to the first entrance to the El Tigre trailer, which is a 7ish hour loop that passes through Corcodavo park. You need permission and payment (you probably can't do this in Dos Brazos) to actually enter the park (although this is likely not checked) and perhaps a guide - but you can walk for perhaps an hour and a half up the trail without entering the park and have the chance to see the same animals. You can do the same from the other trail entrance (it's a loop) which is perhaps 10 minutes down the road right before a small blue building (with a sign mentioning the El Tigre park). \r\n\r\nThere is a fairly fancy tourist information building as well, if you take the left fork on coming into town, although we couldn't find the staff member when we stopped by (but they are apparently there all day). Lots of tours on offer. \r\n\r\nLigias yard has room for several vehicles, although only some spots are flat. Shade is available, but maybe not easily for taller vehicles. \r\n\r\nPrices are negotiable as of this moment, expect to pay between 2000 and 5000 depending on what services you want.

All they do is walking up and down the Street, whistling or using the Merlin app with the Quezales call to attract the birds. Just stick to the group. We saw 1 female and 2 male quezales but the crowd of people scared them away quickly. Around 7:30 am we returned to Hospedaje Monge and just where the track to the waterfall starts was a male quezal in the tree. We had a really nice view at it for a long time before it flew away. There are tour groups coming to Hospedaje Monge as well, so it’s easy to follow them and find the birds. It was nice to see the Quezales but I think a tour with 30-35$ p. P. is way to much. We are happy we saw the birds for free. Normally Hospedaje Monge / Rancho Las Islas charges $6 per person to see the quetzales and do the waterfall trail, but because we camped there it was free for us.","location":{"latitude":9.580767442891913,"longitude":-83.79931765853358},"category":{"name":"Tourist Attraction"}},{"id":138044,"name":"Playa Biesanz","date_verified":"2020-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","description":"There’s a flat space for 2 small vans right in front of the public access to the beach.

He has his adresses around san jose to work with vanagons. (you could call him a project manager aswell since he's got connections all over)\r\nThis is his other adress where he has a place to work.

We set up our hammocs and had a good night with the sound of the waves. The tide can go quite high so park your car up high in between the trees. The view is outstanding. Plenty of people came to the beach but we felt really safe the whole time.","location":{"latitude":9.401665381776924,"longitude":-84.16030515242845},"category":{"name":"Wild Camping"}},{"id":209784,"name":"Hacienda El Rodeó","date_verified":"2023-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Charming small hotel 40 minutes from San José in the quiet mountains and with a swimming pool.

The beach is directly across the street and super clean compared to other stretches we checked out before in this area. There is running water, a toilet and a shower in which apparently lives an iguana. But don't worry it will walk away as soon you make some noises otherwise just ask the owner Charlie for help. We paid 1000 Colones p.P. per night and were happy about this cheap stopover. The owner Charlie speaks also fluent English and is very friendly and helpful. On the campground is space for 3 vehicles, maximum Sprinter size because of the tight fence at the entrance. The road to the spot is hard packed sand with some overhanging branches.

It’s an organic farm project on a huge plot of jungle land by the river, they have an open platform with both queen size beds \u0026 bunk beds, with mosquito netting, looking out on the jungle canopy. Beds are $10/night, and meals are also $10 each. There is a private cabana also available, and listed on Booking.com. The food was really fantastic, Elmer the owner prepares the meals over a wood stove and they included a lot of variety and vegetables grown on the farm! There is also amazingly good Wi-Fi, better than a hostel in town I tried first. \r\n\r\nThey offer some various tours, but you can also hike by yourself up the river to a waterfall. There is an official night tour ($45) that lasts 3 hours, but if you just stay here you’ll catch the part of the tour that comes to the lodging area, and see tree frogs and a variety of other creatures easily. I loved my stay here and wish I had found it sooner! The one downside is that they have 70+ chickens relatively near the sleeping platform, and even with earplugs the roosters woke me up at 4am. But that’s happened throughout Central America, and waking up with the rainforest around you was really special. \r\n\r\nAs an overlander place it’s a bit tricky, because you can’t park directly at it, but for those who like a bit of adventure it’s worth it! It’s possible to park up at the entrance, and then hike down to the lodging. It’s a steep hike that takes about 10 minutes. I was able to safely park my moto at the white house on the hill, which belongs to a family member. Not sure how they’d feel about larger rigs? Google won’t direct you correctly - when it tells you to turn right, instead look for the signs for Rio Agujitas and follow the little road that splits off up the hill. When you see a white house, and a lower driveway with signs, you’re in the right spot! There is another project down the same trail on Google called Treehouse Tentcamp which I think is abandoned now - at the base of the trail cross straight across the river \u0026 follow the signs for Rio Agujitas.

The huge advantage of Costa Rica is that you can find all the parts you want there, there is no need to order them from the UK and wait 1/2 weeks. For sure the price of parts is higher than in the UK (at least twice as expensive). In terms of labor costs, it is more expensive than in Honduras or Guatemala but it remains reasonable.

I did not ask them. \r\n2. You can visit Hacienda Guachipelin and get a tour at the gift shop. There are various tour options available. I have added a pin in ioverlander. I got the all-day adventure pass. It was worth every penny. It was one of the best things I did. please check the Hacienda  Guachipelin pin that I have added for details.\r\n3. You can visit the Simbiosis spa. It costs $39/person for spa treatment. If you can spare some change, that may be worth trying. A pin has been added. They also offer favial and massages.

To me that was important to have so I was willing to pay the 800c entry fee everyday.

We made tours around their campo, wich includes their own piece of jungle, went to visit other family members houses, went to the hot springs at night, worked on our car together and helped them out with processing cañas into sugar. As we found out later, Rafael is a certified tour guide and in general, the whole family knows a lot about the nature of the area. And they keep something like 17 (!) different kinds of (wild)bees, wich was just crazy for us to see. Simply super interesting and kind people. \r\nWe recommend to make a stop here if you pass by. You can get some delicious honey, some good experiences and maybe find some new friends.

To the right is a Laguna where Manatis live. At certain time, you should leave the beach alone at night, since there’s turtle breeding season from may-july. Nice place, quite and safe.
