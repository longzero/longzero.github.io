We did RoRo with WWL yesterday without an agent. I was very worried about that day because the process and involved difficulty is put into a worse light than needed (in my opinion at least), so I would like to make a positive statement about it for once: IT IS NOT THAT BAD! Just like a big border day. You go to 3-4 different offices, then get your car inspected and off you go. Of course it is a little stressful, but if you have been ok with the borders, you will be ok here. Even more than ok, because people were much more helpful (locals and officials) than at many borders. Also to note: Fewer people than at borders and no pushy helpers. Just follow the steps 1-4 on iOverlander and you will be fine. We started at 8 o´clock at the office of the Shipping company (nicest office, but unfriendliest people of the day) and were done with it all by 1:30 pm.\r\n\r\nAnd if you need a wall to be put in behind your drivers compartment for roro: Procars in Panama City do it (on ioverlander) at around 50$.\r\n\r\nAgent: Not needed in my opinion with all the info available online etc.\r\n\r\nPolice Inspection (Things I did not know): You can turn up at that parkinglot very early to draw a number if you want. Some people got Number 9 at 6 am (??!), but we got number 14 at 7:30 am and did not have to wait long to have the car inspected, so I think it is not worth it getting there THAT early. One thing which did take much longer than expected (and was a problem for others because they had an appointment with their agent or something) was picking up the Papers at 2. We waited for over an hour, so have that time accounted for.\r\n\r\nRoad from Panama City to Colon (also very diff. to find info): Panapass is only for the coredor norte, not for the road to Colon. If you get out of the city without the Coredor norte (no problem really), then you will get to a \"cuota\" road to colon at some point. Here you pay 2,50$ cash and off you ride. We started driving at 6:30 on a weekday from the Yacht Club and got to the Terminal in Colon at 8:15.\r\nMaybe this helps someone to relax about it all.

She will either admit or decline your pet on the flight of your choice.  After you have done the veterinarian health certificate and the MIDA form you need to come here. Begin by looking at flights that work for you. (mornings are best so you have time for paperwork at other end, read about it in ioverlander at Cartagena airport before you go)\r\nOnce you have flight in mind, go to this counter with the kennel, the dog, copies of all paper work and patience. She will approve the kennel and the pet.  Note that if the pet is aggressive, scary, old, or certain breeds she can deny it to fly! You must have food and water taped to the kennel and two dishes to dispense them in.  (Kennels available at Discovery Center also marked on iOverlander)\r\nAsk her to give you any forms that are needed.  Complete them and have her review and submit them  Wait for her to give you a bill of lading and confirmation number that corresponds with the flight you selected.  Pay the fees and confirm that things are all set.  Ask her where and when you need to check in with the pet.  Ask her to email you all confirmations and documentations. \r\nOur story- We arranged all the reservations by email with CopaCargo.  We went directly to the loading dock confirm the kennel. We submitted photos of all paperwork and were send confirmations.  We believed we were all set for the flight and then the night before they sent MORE papers to complete in a locked PDF format.  We found a way to complete them and emailed the papers back the night before the flight.  The next morning we checked in with the dog 3.5 hours before the flight. (as per the paperwork we had completed) This power-woman said that we were too late, then said that nothing was confirmed and we had no reservation, then looked for errors on the papers, problems with the kennel, etc.  She ultimately reviewed all the saved emails I had screen shots of and all the photos of being at the loading dock and relented.   Essentially she was trying to do everything possible to deny flying the dog on the flight we had reserved.  I have never seen a company work so hard to NOT accept business.  Even once we were finished and ready to walk away I was told I would get an email describing the pick up process and confirming the booking while we were in flight.  It has been a week and no such email has yet been received.  Please feel free to contact me for further info. \r\nNOTE: I cannot condone illegal or immoral behavior, but there are veterinarians that will write a certificate stating that your dog needs to accompany you on the airplane.  (ESA) If you and your pet are up for it, that may be simpler than this crazy process.  You still need health documents, but you can avoid CopaCargo altogether.","location":{"latitude":9.06709,"longitude":-79.38611},"category":{"name":"Pet Services"}},{"id":67853,"name":"Restaurant El Viajero \u0026 Gas Station","date_verified":"2023-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Just a spot to spend a night just out of the Pan-American highway and pursuing your driving next day.

It is today a vibrant but downtrodden neighborhood which everyone will tell you to avoid.  \r\n\r\nWe hooked up with Victor of @localinpty (Instagram), who does cultural walking tours of Casco, Santa Ana, and El Chorillo.  He also gives a lot back to the community, teaching English to both adults and children, setting up safe places for kids to play and learn, and is creating an amazing community outreach and educational program for adventurous travellers.  We were completely safe in Victor\"s hands and our two hour walkabout was one of the highlights of our time in Panama.  \r\n\r\nVictor charges $75 per person for a three hour walking tour, but realize that he gives back so much to the community we felt like it was a worthy cause.\r\n\r\nIf you want an experience well out of the mainstream, we highly recommend Victor.  He is the only one doing tours to this area and has a good rapport with the police and the locals.

It’s mostly upscale Cabanas ($70+/night) but they do have a few budget rooms of $40/night which for this island are quite reasonably priced. The setting is absolutely beautiful, it’s a multi-story treehouse lodge on a cliff overlooking the ocean. Very close to the start of Playa Bluff, and with its own little cove where I was able to swim in little tide pools despite the waves being a bit high. \r\n\r\nThe restaurant served breakfast \u0026 dinner, no lunch, and is staffed by young “volunteers”. I personally felt like the dinners were very overpriced (around $13.00), but the breakfast was good ($5.50 includes drinks/coffee). There is also a really good hostel style kitchen, so it would be better to bring your own food and cook here. In general the young volunteer staff was kind of the downside, they were a bit unorganized and unhelpful during my stay. \r\n\r\nThe Wi-Fi works well in the main lodge/restaurant but does not extend to the cabins. I was able to park my motorcycle right at the base of the lodge in a safe spot off to the side. There is only parking for about 3 cars (one spot up top, two down at the base of the driveway) so I don’t feel like this place is 4wheel overlander friendly, but you could probably squeeze several motos in here depending on size. Fun fact, I’m pretty sure Itchy Boots stayed here too!\r\n\r\nThe highlight besides the beautiful location, sound of the ocean at night, and peaceful atmosphere, is that there is a tame injured Toucan that lives near the lodge, and comes to visit in the mornings. He was super sweet and you are able to see him very upclose, which is amazing. There are also howler monkeys \u0026 hummingbirds around.","location":{"latitude":9.387259,"longitude":-82.23616},"category":{"name":"Hostel"}},{"id":216799,"name":"Panama Kite Center","date_verified":"2024-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Panama Kite Center is a kiteboarding school in Front of the lagoon. \r\n\r\nThe owner, Florian, is German and welcomes overlanders to stay on the grounds. \r\n\r\nThey have glamping and studios in remodeled shipping containers.

Nous voulions respecter les règles et mettre notre chien dans une cage, et cette cage serait dans la soute d'un avion. \r\n\r\nOn a donc fait toutes les démarches administratives (voir le point rouge Ioverlander \"exit visa for dog\", où j'ai décrit le processus pour obtenir un certificat de bonne santé et un permis d'exportation au MIDA). \r\n\r\nOn voulait voyager avec ma compagnie lowcost Wingo, mais en allant au guichet de l'aéroport, on nous a dit qu'ils ne prenaient pas les chiens en soute dans l'avion. \r\n\r\nOn s'est renseigné sur Avianca, mais c'est compliqué et il y a forcément une escale en plus et le vol dure plus de 5 heures. \r\n\r\nEnfin, on a pris contact avec Copa Airlines. Mais on a eu affaire à des gens totalement incompétents, méchants, qui ne nous ont pas du tout aidé, au contraire. Seuls les correspondances par e-mail sont possibles (pas possible de réserver ou d'avoir des informations pour le chien à un guichet ou par téléphone).\r\nMais les gens de Copa Cargo mettent de nombreuses heures à répondre à nos messages, et ne répondent jamais clairement à nos questions.\r\nEn gros, il fallait remplir au moins 10 formulaires, leur transmettre pour qu'ils demandent l'autorisation pour mettre le chien dans un vol bien précis tôt le matin entre le lundi et le jeudi (il faut anticiper et faire la demande au moins 1 semaine avant pour avoir la réponse, sinon impossible de réserver notre propre vol car il y a le risque qu'il n'y ait plus de place!) Et enfin faire un pré-check à la zone cargo de l'aéroport de Tocumen la veille du départ... \r\n\r\nPour un chien de 16 Kg et une cage de 8 Kg, on nous demandait 239$! Sans parler d'autres taxes de déchargement, du coût du taxi / Uber, etc... sans parler du fait qu'il fallait aussi payer en plus des frais de manutention côté Colombie: 55$ + 89$... \r\n\r\nBref, au bout de 3 jours sans avancées et sans réponses claires, on a abandonné cette option avec Copa. On avait entendu parler de voyageurs qui avaient fait passer leur chien (de plus de 10 Kg) pour un chien de support émotionnel. En gros, le voyageur a besoin de son chien en cabine avec lui pour se sentir bien et ne pas être trop stressé... \r\nOn a donc suivi cette voie pour obtenir auprès d'un psychologue (pour humains) un certificat de chien de support émotionnel. Évidemment, c'est un business pour eux car en 10mn de consultation, ils gagnent 100$ en liquide... mais ça reste un investissement rentable car la compagnie Wingo accepte gratuitement les chiens de support émotionnel en cabine! Il suffit de produire le certificat. \r\n\r\nJ'ai donc réservé sur internet mon billet, et j'ai ajouté le chien d'assistance (ça peut se faire soit lors de l'achat du billet dans les options spéciales, soit via un tchat whastapp gratuit). Il peut nous être demandé de prendre une option pour réserver un siège avec de l'espace supplémentaire pour les pieds (33 $ en plus) afin de coucher le chien, mais ce n'est pas sûr. \r\n\r\nIl suffit alors simplement de se présenter au guichet d'enregistrement des bagages le jour du vol avec le certificat de support émotionnel, les papiers en règle du chien et c'est bon! \r\n\r\nPour la petite histoire, ce fut extrêmement compliqué d'acheter nos billets car par 2 fois, j'ai reçu un mail annulant automatiquement ma réservation au motif que les 2 cartes bancaires que j'avais utilisées (carte visa crédit puis carte visa débit) étaient susceptibles d'avoir été utilisées frauduleusement, ce qui n'était bien sûr pas le cas. \r\n\r\nPour résumer, j'ai été obligé quasiment d'utiliser une voie contestable moralement, mais quasiment nécessaire. Ça nous a coûté environ 500$ pour faire Panama - Cartagena, avec 2 adultes, 1 chien et l'obtention du papier du psychologue. Un autre couple de français a fait la même chose que nous sur le même vol, et un allemand avait fait pareil la semaine d'avant. \r\nNous restons sur une très mauvaise impression du Panama, dommage. \r\n\r\nBon courage pour les suivants, car il vous en faudra.

Especially if you don't know Spanish.\r\n\r\n - for our part, we made contact several weeks before (even if sometimes it's hard to plan to know when we will arrive in Panama City when we are in road trip mode) with the Overland Ambassy company, in the person of the  very friendly and competent Alejandro.  He is bilingual in Spanish/English.  He can be reached by WhatsApp at +50767800065.\r\n\r\n Check with him the availability of the ships to reserve a place (we pay a deposit of 150 USD by bank transfer, but we can move the date free of charge if necessary).\r\n\r\n You will be added to a Whatsapp group, along with other travelers who will be traveling on the same day as you, so that Alejandro can give you all the information.\r\n\r\n For containers, there are departures approximately every week.  For the Roro, it is less frequent.\r\n I'm going to tell you about the container procedure, for which we paid around 2,200 USD all inclusive.  It has the enormous advantage of being completely secure (no theft possible because the container is sealed in front of us) and its cost is twice as expensive as Roro (more than 4,000 USD).\r\n\r\nOnly drawback: the maximum height of the vehicle must be 2m57.  You can adjust the tire pressure if necessary to gain precious centimeters... On the other hand, for a large motorhome in a flat rack, the prices are more around 8,000 USD for example.\r\n\r\n - you will receive by email 2 pdf files explaining the steps to take on both sides.\r\n\r\n - for the police inspection, it must be done between 5 days and 3 days before the planned loading date.  Do not underestimate that the day will be tiring with a lot of waiting.  Do not be afraid of the neighborhood where the inspection is carried out, even if it is not very inviting.  You can, however, sleep the day before at the Ioverlander point located opposite the police which is on the other side of the street, where you will return in the AM: it's safe!\r\n\r\n Come very early in the morning (at least 1 hour / 1 hour 30 minutes before the recommended time) so as not to wait too long, even if you will never be the first).\r\n Park in the small street opposite the Police gate: don't be afraid, it's going well!\r\n\r\nJoin the people already waiting on the sidewalk (they are probably car exporters, they come here very often and can explain to you), and they will tell you that you are the Xth.  You are asked to come in pants and a long-sleeved top, for some reason...\r\n\r\n Then the gate opens and you are given a small piece of paper with your number (the Xth).  You will need to present the requested papers (2 bundles of photocopies and the originals) when you are called.\r\n\r\n If the TIP made at the border when entering the country contains an error (this was our case), quickly go to the customs offices (see on Ioverlander Adouana: it's about 30 minutes away) and have the TIP modified,  before returning.  You have to be back before 10 a.m. maximum!\r\n\r\n Then you wait again.  Then, a police officer comes to check the chassis numbers (VIN) and engine numbers on your vehicle.\r\n\r\n Afterwards, you have to come back in the afternoon, to a separate but very close place, on the other side of the street, to collect the paper needed for the rest (expect a significant wait - 3 hours for us).\r\n Use the Ioverlander application to find these places (activate the right filters).\r\n\r\n - Once the precious sesame has been collected, immediately go to the Overland Embassy agency, about 30 minutes by car.\r\n\r\nDo the paperwork with Alejandro and his team (they can make photocopies if necessary) and pay the fees of around 1,000 USD (preferably in cash, because it is cheaper despite the withdrawal commissions than paying 5% in credit card)  .  That's all!\r\n\r\n You then have free access for 2 days if you want to the agency's small campsite, which allows you to park in a secure place near other travelers, and to benefit from a shared mobile home with showers, toilets,  kitchen, washing machine, wifi, etc... Very practical!\r\n If you want to stay longer, you will have to pay a little extra.\r\n\r\n - clean your vehicle thoroughly so as not to have any problems with Customs later.\r\n\r\n - prepare your belongings in luggage, so that you can last during 15 days.  Keep all your papers (especially the TIP).\r\n\r\n - On the D-day of loading, we meet either early in the morning at this campsite or at Colon (north, 1 hour drive) and we follow each other in a convoy to reach the loading location  near the port of Colon.\r\n Highway costs are covered by Overland Embassy.\r\n\r\n The vehicles are then mounted on a tow truck and loaded into a container.  We disconnect the battery.  It is interesting to buy moisture absorbers to put in the vehicle.  We lock it and keep the key with us.\r\n\r\n Then the container is closed and sealed (note the seal number).  Note the container number for tracking.  A stamp is placed on the vehicle owner's passport signifying that the vehicle is released from Panama.\r\n Finally, we are taken back by shuttle free of charge to the Panama City agency.\r\n\r\n- now you will be able to organize your almost 2 weeks of waiting.  You can do as you wish: stay in Panama to visit or go to Cartagena (subject to an important point developed in the next paragraph).\r\n It's up to you to book hotel or Airbnb rooms...\r\n\r\n\r\n 1-2/ PLANE.\r\n\r\n I will only talk about plane, but it is also possible to take a boat which takes several days at sea. The price is higher than the plane, but it must include meals.  Up to you.\r\n\r\n - there are 3 airlines: Copa Airlines (the main one, but the most expensive), Avianca (no direct flight to Cartagena) and Wingo.  The first 2 depart from Tocumen International Airport (to the East) and the last leaves from Pacifico (to the West).\r\n\r\n It is very important to see with Alejandro when you can legally depart from Panama, as some agents at the airport counter require proof of departure from Colombia to another country (plane ticket).  But for us traveling by vehicle, this is not possible.\r\n You must provide the TIP, passport stamp and container tracking.  But sometimes that's not enough.  Some agents require that the departure of the vehicle by sea takes place within a maximum of 2 days of our departure by plane.\r\n Alejandro will explain to you what you need to do.  With Wingo for our part, we had to fight 1h30 with 3 couples in the same situation and call Alejandro by phone).\r\n It took some sleight of hand on the tracking site for them to finally agree to give us our boarding passes.\r\n\r\n - Wingo is the cheapest company.\r\n But booking online with Wingo can be complicated because depending on your credit card, the reservation may either be impossible or canceled by email just a few hours after making it, under the pretext that they have a doubt about your bank card.  Check your email carefully!  There are other possible means of payment, such as paying at certain approved banks.\r\n\r\n Due to the fact that it is a low cost company, the prices are affordable.  Try to only take cabin baggage if you can, as checked baggage costs more.\r\n\r\n1-3/ DOG OWNERS:\r\n\r\n 1-31- The procedures are extremely complicated if you want to use the classic route, namely putting your dog in a cage, which will go in the hold of the plane.  For this, only the Copa company offers it, but it is an obstacle course, and I weigh my words carefully.\r\n\r\n COPA: all correspondence with them is done only by email.  They don't answer the phone and there's no point going to a counter because they can't do anything for us.  In the emails, everything is done in Spanish and they do not respond at all to specific questions and requests for explanations.  We are left to our own devices!  Not to mention that their response comes with a wait of at least half a day...\r\n\r\n In addition, prices depend on the size and weight of the animal (240 USD requested for our 16 kg dog!).\r\n You have to do it more than 1 week in advance (it would be even better if we had a lot more time before, but it's hard to predict) by filling out piles of stupid papers (never requested to come from Europe to  Canada) and sending photos of the dog in and out of its cage (they don't joke with the size of the cage which must allow the dog to stand up with a margin...).  The idea is that they lock a place for the dog on a morning flight between Monday and Thursday only.  This reservation takes quite a while, and until we have the answer, it is impossible for us to get a plane ticket for ourselves (and in the meantime, places are becoming rarer and more expensive  ).\r\n In addition, it is necessary to do a pre-check in the cargo area of ​​the airport the day before, hence significant Uber fees...\r\n And on the big day, you have to go back to drop off the dog, then go to the terminal which is not on site.  More Uber fees... Note that upon arrival in Colombia, there are fees of around 150 USD for unloading and customs clearance.\r\n In short, you understand, it's hell!  After 4 days, we gave up.\r\n\r\n 1-32- SOLUTION FOUND:\r\n it may be morally questionable, but it actually works.\r\n\r\nThe trick is to consult a psychologist in Panama City in order to obtain an emotional dog certificate (a general practitioner cannot do this and you absolutely need the letterhead of a psychologist on the paper).  Basically, this means that we have a deep psychological need to travel with our dog because we are making this trip following a burn-out in France, and we need the dog in the cabin with us.\r\n\r\nWe therefore have to make the psychologist believe that we are very stressed, that the situation in Panama City is causing us a lot of worry because we cannot get our dog into the hold, that we do not have confidence in the  way that the employees will treat him in his cage, that as a result we have been sleeping very poorly for a few days, etc...\r\n For a consultation of 100 USD in cash, the psychologist has no difficulty in delivering the precious paper.  Rest assured, even if it seems like a large sum, it will be immediately paid for because with Wingo, emotional dogs are allowed in the cabin... for free!\r\n To find a psychologist, Google is your friend.  We consulted Doctor Edgard Agames, who can be reached by WhatsApp at +50767479449, but there are others!\r\n\r\n Please note that this document is valid for 1 year, and that it also allows access to places normally prohibited with \"normal\" dogs (such as public transport).  So keep this paper with you afterwards.\r\n\r\n Then simply book your plane tickets on the Wingo website, by selecting to add a dog (if you can't find one, use the free WhatsApp chat to communicate with an advisor who can do it for you)  .\r\n\r\n Depending on the size of the dog, it may be useful to reserve a seat with more foot room as even a large dog can in theory be accommodated.\r\n\r\n1-33- At the same time, you must have a certificate of good health for the animal less than 10 days old (around 35 USD in the city) and go to MIDA in the city center to obtain an export certificate (10  USD): see my post on Ioverlander.  It's super fast: less than 1 hour.  These documents must be presented on the day of boarding.\r\n\r\n 1-34- On the big day, take an Uber to reach Pacifico airport (less than 10 USD from the city center).  Present the emotional dog certificate and dog papers at the check-in counter, and voila!\r\n The flight lasts 1 hour 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n Upon arrival in Cartagena, you will need to complete import papers at the airport (approximately 25 USD).  For us, it was an official agent who approached us in the queue to leave the secure area.  It was quick.\r\n\r\n\r\n 2/ COLOMBIA (Cartagena).\r\n\r\n 2-1- WAIT\r\n\r\n - You will have time to visit this pretty city, but be careful, it is VERY hot.\r\n You must choose accommodation, if possible flexible enough to be able to add additional nights in the event of a delay (or change accommodation).\r\n For our part, we had counted on a D+15 recovery after loading in Panama, and it worked out well!\r\n\r\n Personally, we booked an Airbnb in the Manga district, not far from the center, offering good value for money and known for being safe.  We were not disappointed.\r\n\r\n Some opt to leave Panama City directly to Medellin or Bogota to visit other cities in the meantime, then they fly back to Cartagena to pick up their car...\r\n\r\n - you can watch the tracking of the container on the website given by Alejandro, just to see if it is late leaving Panama.\r\n\r\n But above all, you will receive information on a Whatsapp group created by Ana Rodriguez, who works with Alejandro, and who takes care of all the procedures upon arrival.  She only speaks in Spanish, and although very nice, she communicates little and it is sometimes a little complicated to understand what she says because of the inaccuracies of the translation applications, but it can be done.  Don't hesitate to ask questions...\r\n\r\n - take advantage of the wait to withdraw money in cash (approximately the equivalent of 1000 USD in local currency, the peso).  See on Ioverlander, the Davivienda bank in the historic center allows withdrawals of 2,000,000 pesos in one go, which reduces commission costs.  You can pay Ana by credit card, but it will cost you more.\r\n\r\n2-2- Unloading.\r\n\r\n A few days after the arrival of the boat, unloading is carried out.  You will be informed on the Whatsapp group that you must present yourself at the port, still in pants and with a long-sleeved top.  You will check the condition and number of the container seal, then you take the car out of the container.  We need to check the condition (no damage for the 5 cars we had) and take photos of the 4 sides of the car as well as the VIN number to send to Ana.  Then you leave without your car.  It remains parked at the port, doors locked.  The keys are entrusted to a port employee.  There has never been a problem.\r\n\r\n 2-3- TIP\r\n\r\n Approximately 2 working days later, customs will have produced the TIP.  For her part, Ana will have taken out SOAT insurance for you to be able to drive for 1 month in Colombia (the price is included in what you will pay her).  You will have an appointment in a restaurant not far from the port with an agent from the Ana company to sign the TIP.\r\n\r\n 2.3- Payment and recovery of the vehicle.\r\n\r\n - The next day (or not far away), you will first meet at Ana's offices to pay her.  It is located south of the port, and you need to take an Uber because it is far and not easy to find.\r\n\r\n - Then head to the port, still in long clothes, to collect your vehicle.  A few signatures of papers, and it's over!!!  You are ready to attack South America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Hoping that the tutorial helps you in turn.

Surtout si vous ne maîtrisez pas l'espagnol. \r\n\r\n- pour notre part, on a pris contact plusieurs semaines avant (même si parfois, c'est dur de se projeter pour savoir quand on arrivera à Panama City quand on est en mode road trip) avec la société Overland Ambassy, en la personne du très sympathique et compétent Alejandro. Il est bilingue espagnol / anglais. On peut le joindre par WhatsApp au +50767800065. \r\n\r\nVoir avec lui les disponibilités des navires pour réserver une place (on paie un acompte de 150 USD par virement bancaire, mais on peut déplacer gratuitement la date si besoin). \r\n\r\nVous serez ajouté sur un groupe Whatsapp, ainsi que les autres voyageurs qui vont voyager le même jour que vous, afin qu'Alejandro puisse vous donner toutes les informations. \r\n\r\nPour les containers, il y a des départs toutes les semaines environ. Pour les Roro, c'est moins fréquent. \r\nJe vais vous parler de la procédure en container, pour laquelle nous avons payé environ 2.200 USD tout compris. Il présente l'énorme avantage d'être totalement sécurisé (pas de vol possible car le container est scellé devant nous) et son coût est 2 fois moins cher que pour du Roro (plus de 4.000 USD). \r\n\r\nSeul inconvénient: la hauteur maximum du véhicule doit être de 2m57. On peut jouer si besoin sur la pression des pneus pour gagner de précieux centimètres... En revanche, pour un gros camping-car dans un flat rack, les prix sont plutôt de l'ordre de 8.000 USD par exemple. \r\n\r\n- vous recevrez par mail 2 fichiers pdf vous expliquant les démarches à réaliser des 2 côtés. \r\n\r\n- pour l'inspection de police, elle est à faire entre 5 jours et 3 jours avant la date de chargement prévu. Ne pas sous-estimer que la journée sera fatigante avec beaucoup d'attente. Ne pas avoir peur du quartier où est réalisée l'inspection, même s'il est peu engageant. Vous pouvez en revanche dormir la veille sur le point Ioverlander se situant en face de la police qui est de l'autre côté de la rue, là où vous reviendrez l'AM: c'est safe! \r\n\r\nVenir très tôt le matin (au moins 1h / 1h30 avant l'heure recommandée) pour ne pas  trop attendre, même si vous ne serez jamais le premier). \r\nGarez-vous dans la petite rue qui est en face du portail de la Police: n'ayez pas peur, ça se passe bien! \r\n\r\nRejoindre les gens qui attendent déjà sur le trottoir (ce sont sûrement des exportateurs de voiture, ils viennent ici très souvent et peuvent vous expliquer), et ils vous diront que vous êtes le Xème. Il est demandé de venir en pantalon et en vêtement haut à manches longues, pour une raison que j'ignore... \r\n\r\nPuis le portail s'ouvre et on vous donne un petit bout de papier avec votre numéro (le Xème). Vous devrez présenter les papiers demandés (2 liasses de photocopies et les originaux) quand on vous appellera. \r\n\r\nSi le TIP réalisé à la frontière en entrant dans le pays comporte une erreur (c'était notre cas), filez rapidement aux bureaux de douanes (voir sur Ioverlander Adouana: c'est à environ 30mn de route) et faites modifier le TIP, avant de revenir. Il faut être de retour avant 10 heures maximum! \r\n\r\nPuis vous attendez encore. Ensuite, un policier vient contrôler sur votre véhicule les numéros de châssis (VIN) et de moteur. \r\n\r\nAprès, il faut revenir l'après-midi, dans un endroit distinct mais très proche, de l'autre côté de la rue, pour récupérer un papier nécessaire pour la suite (prévoir une attente conséquente - 3 heures pour nous). \r\nS'aider de l'application Ioverlander pour trouver ces endroits (activez les bons filtres). \r\n\r\n- Une fois le précieux sésame récupéré, se rendre dans la foulée à l'agence Overland Ambassy, à environ 30mn de voiture. \r\n\r\nFaire les papiers avec Alejandro et son équipe (ils peuvent faire les photocopies si besoin) et payez les frais d'environ 1.000 USD (de préférence en cash, car ça revient moins cher malgré les commissions de retrait que de payer 5% en CB). C'est tout! \r\n\r\nOn a alors accès gratuitement pendant 2 jours si l'on veut au petit camping de l'agence, qui permet de se garer dans un endroit sécurisé auprès d'autres voyageurs, et de bénéficier d'un mobilhome en commun avec douches, toilettes, cuisine, lave-linge, wifi, etc... Très pratique!\r\nSi vous voulez rester plus longtemps, il faudra payer un petit supplément. \r\n\r\n- bien nettoyer votre véhicule pour ne pas avoir de soucis avec les Douanes plus tard. \r\n\r\n- préparez vos affaires dans des bagages, pour pouvoir tenir pendant une quinzaine de jours. Gardez bien tous vos papiers (dont le TIP surtout). \r\n\r\n- Le jour J du chargement, on se donne rendez-vous soit tôt le matin au niveau de ce camping, soit au niveau de Colon (au nord à 1 heure de route) et on se suit en convoi pour rejoindre l'endroit de chargement près du port de Colon.\r\nLes frais d'autoroute sont pris en charge par Overland Ambassy. \r\n\r\nLes véhicules sont alors montés sur une dépanneuse et chargés dans un container. On débranche la batterie. Il est intéressant d'acheter des absorbeurs d'humidité à mettre dans le véhicule. On ferme à clés et on garde la clé avec nous. \r\n\r\nPuis le container est fermé et scellé (noter le numéro du scellé). Notez le numéro du container pour le tracking. Un tampon est apposé sur le passeport du propriétaire du véhicule signifiant que le véhicule est libéré du Panama.\r\nEnfin, on est ramenés en navette gratuitement à l'agence de Panama City. \r\n\r\n- maintenant, vous allez pouvoir organiser vos presques 2 semaines d'attente. Vous pouvez faire comme bon vous semble: rester au Panama pour visiter ou aller à Carthagène (sous réserve d'un point important développé dans le paragraphe suivant).\r\nA vous de réserver des chambres d'hôtel ou d'Airbnb... \r\n\r\n\r\n1-2/ AVION. \r\n\r\nJe ne parlerai que d'avion, mais il est aussi possible de prendre un bateau qui met plusieurs jours de mer. Le tarif est plus élevé que l'avion, mais il doit comprendre les repas. A vous de voir. \r\n\r\n- il y a 3 compagnies aériennes: Copa Airlines (la principale, mais la plus chère), Avianca (pas de vol direct vers Carthagène) et Wingo. Les 2 premières partent de l'aéroport international de Tocumen (à l'Est) et la dernière part de Pacifico (à l'Ouest). \r\n\r\nIl est très important de voir avec Alejandro quand vous pouvez légalement partir du Panama, car certains agents au comptoir de l'aéroport exigent une preuve de départ de Colombie vers un autre pays (billet d'avion). Mais pour nous voyageurs en véhicule, ce n'est pas possible.\r\nIl faut fournir le TIP, le tampon du passeport et le tracking du container. Mais parfois ça ne suffit pas. Certains agents exigent que le départ du véhicule par voie maritime ait lieu à maximum 2 jours de notre départ en avion.\r\nAlejandro vous expliquera ce que vous devez faire. Avec Wingo pour notre part, on a dû batailler 1h30 à 3 couples dans le même cas et appeler Alejandro par téléphone). \r\nIl a fallu un tour de passe-passe sur le site du tracking pour qu'ils acceptent finalement de nous donner nos cartes d'embarquement. \r\n\r\n- Wingo est la compagnie la moins cher.\r\nMais la réservation par internet chez Wingo peut être compliquée car selon votre CB, la réservation peut être soit impossible, soit annulée par mail quelques heures seulement après l'avoir réalisée, sous pretexte qu'ils ont un doute sur votre carte bancaire. Vérifiez bien votre mail! Il y a d'autres moyens de paiement possibles, comme aller payer dans certaines banques agréés. \r\n\r\nDu fait qu'il s'agisse d'une compagnie low costs, les tarifs sont abordables. Essayez de prendre uniquement des bagages cabines si vous le pouvez, car un bagage en soute coûte plus cher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1-3/  PROPRIETAIRES DE CHIENS: \r\n\r\n1-31- Les démarches sont extrêmement compliquées si vous voulez utiliser la voie classique, à savoir mettre votre chien dans une cage, laquelle ira en soute de l'avion. Pour cela, seule la compagnie Copa le propose, mais c'est le parcours du combattant, et je pèse mes mots. \r\n\r\nCOPA: toute correspondance avec eux se fait uniquement par mail. Ils ne répondent pas par téléphone et il est inutile d'aller à un guichet car ils ne peuvent rien faire pour nous. Dans les mails, tout se fait en espagnol et ils ne répondent pas du tout aux questions précises et aux demandes d'explication. On est livrés à nous-mêmes! Sans parler que leur réponse se fait avec une attente d'au moins une demi-journée... \r\n\r\nDe plus, les tarifs dépendent de la taille et du poids de l'animal (240 USD demandés pour notre chien de 16 Kg !).\r\nIl faut s'y prendre plus d'1 semaine avant (ce serait encore mieux si on avait beaucoup plus de temps avant, mais c'est dur à prévoir) en remplissant des tas de papiers débiles (jamais demandés pour venir d'Europe au Canada) et en envoyant des photos du chien dans et en dehors de sa cage (ils ne plaisantent pas avec la taille de la cage qui doit permettre au chien de tenir debout avec une marge...). L'idée est qu'ils verrouillent une place pour le chien sur un vol du matin entre lundi et jeudi uniquement. Cette réservation prend pas mal de temps, et tant qu'on n'a pas la réponse, impossible pour nous de prendre un billet d'avion pour nous-mêmes (et pendant ce temps là, les places se font plus rares et plus chères).\r\nDe plus, il est nécessaire de faire un pré-check en zone cargo de l'aéroport la veille, d'où des frais d'Uber consequents...\r\nEt le jour J, il faut y retourner pour déposer le chien, puis aller à l'aérogare qui n'est pas sur place. Encore des frais d'Uber... A noter qu'à l'arrivée en Colombie, il y a des frais d'environ 150 USD pour le déchargement et le dédouanement.\r\nBref, vous avez compris, c'est l'enfer! Au bout de 4 jours, on a abandonné. \r\n\r\n1-32- SOLUTION TROUVÉE: \r\nelle peut être discutable sur le plan de la morale, mais elle fonctionne réellement. \r\n\r\nL'astuce est d'aller consulter un psychologue à Panama City afin d'obtenir un certificat de chien émotionnel (un medecin generaliste ne peut pas le faire et il faut absolument l'en-tête d'un psychologue sur le papier). En gros, ça veut dire qu'on a un profond besoin psychologique de voyager avec notre chien car on fait ce voyage suite à un burn-out en France, et qu'on a besoin du chien dans la cabine auprès de nous. \r\n\r\nIl faut donc faire croire au psy qu'on est très stressés, que la situation à Panama City nous engendre beaucoup d'inquiétudes car on n'arrive pas à faire passer notre chien en soute, qu'on n'a pas confiance dans la manière que les employés vont le traiter dans sa cage, que du coup on dort très mal depuis quelques jours, etc...\r\nMoyennant une consultation de 100 USD en cash, le psy ne fait aucune difficulté à délivrer le précieux papier. Rassurez-vous, même si ça paraît être une grosse somme, elle sera immédiatement amortie car avec Wingo, les chiens émotionnels sont autorisés en cabine... gratuitement!\r\nPour trouver un psy, Google est votre ami. On a consulté le Docteur Edgard Agames joignable par WhatsApp au +50767479449, mais il y en a d'autres! \r\n\r\nA noter que ce papier est valable 1 an, et qu'il permet aussi d'avoir accès à des lieux normalement interdits avec des chiens \"normaux\" (comme des transports en commun). Gardez donc bien ce papier avec vous par la suite. \r\n\r\nIl suffit ensuite de réserver vos billets d'avion sur le site internet de Wingo, en sélectionnant l'ajout d'un chien (si vous ne trouvez pas, utilisez le tchat whatsapp gratuit pour communiquer avec un conseiller qui pourra le faire pour vous). \r\n\r\nSelon la taille du chien, il peut être utile de réserver un siège offrant une plus grande place au niveau des pieds car même un gros chien peut en théorie être accepté. \r\n\r\n\r\n1-33- Parallèlement à ça, il faut avoir un certificat de bonne santé de l'animal datant de moins de 10 jours (environ 35 USD en ville) et aller au MIDA dans le centre ville pour obtenir un certificat d'exportation (10 USD): voir mon post sur Ioverlander. C'est hyper rapide: moins d'1 heure. Ces documents seront à présenter le jour de l'embarquement. \r\n\r\n1-34-  Le jour J, prendre un Uber pour rejoindre l'aéroport Pacifico (moins de 10 USD depuis le centre-ville). Présenter le certificat de chien émotionnel et les papiers du chien au comptoir d'enregistrement, et le tour est joué!\r\nLe vol dure 1h15. \r\n\r\nA l'arrivée à Carthagène, vous devrez faire les papiers d'importation à l'aéroport (25 USD environ). Pour nous, c'est un agent officiel qui nous a abordé dans la queue pour sortir de la zone sécurisée. C'était rapide.\r\n\r\n\r\n2/ COLOMBIE (Carthagène). \r\n\r\n2-1- ATTENTE \r\n\r\n- Vous allez avoir du temps pour visiter cette jolie ville, mais attention, il y fait TRÈS chaud. \r\nVous devez prendre un hébergement, si possible assez souple pour pouvoir rajouter des nuits supplementaires en cas de retard (ou changer d'hébergement).\r\nPour notre part, on avait misé sur une récupération J+15 après le chargement au Panama, et c'est tombé bien! \r\n\r\nPersonnellement, on a réservé un Airbnb dans le quartier Manga, pas loin du centre, offrant un bon rapport qualité/ prix et réputé pour être safe. On n'a pas été déçu. \r\n\r\nCertains optent pour partir de Panama City en allant directement à Medellin ou Bogota afin de visiter d'autres villes en attendant, puis ils reviennent en avion à Carthagène pour récupérer leur voiture... \r\n\r\n- vous pourrez regarder le tracking du container sur le site internet donné par Alejandro, histoire de voir si ca prend du retard au départ de Panama. \r\n\r\nMais surtout, vous recevrez des informations sur un groupe Whatsapp créé par Ana Rodriguez, qui travaille avec Alejandro, et qui s'occupe de toutes les démarches à l'arrivée. Elle ne parle qu'en Espagnol, et bien que très gentille, elle communique peu et il est parfois un peu compliqué de comprendre ce qu'elle dit à cause des imprecisions des applications de traduction, mais ça se fait. Il ne faut pas hésiter à lui poser des questions... \r\n\r\n- profitez de l'attente pour aller retirer de l'argent en cash (environ l'équivalent de 1000 USD en monnaie locale, le peso). Voir sur Ioverlander, la banque Davivienda du centre historique permet des retraits de 2.000.000 de pesos en une fois, ce qui permet de réduire les frais de commissions. Vous pouvez payer Ana en CB, mais ça vous coûtera plus cher. \r\n\r\n2-2- Déchargement. \r\n\r\nQuelques jours après l'arrivée du bateau, le déchargement est réalisé. Vous serez informés sur le groupe Whatsapp qu'il faut vous présenter au port, toujours en pantalon et avec un vêtement haut à manches longues. Vous allez vérifier l'état et le numero du scellé du container, puis vous sortez la voiture du container. Il faut vérifier l'état (aucun dommage pour les 5 voitures qu'on était) et faire des photos des 4 faces de la voitures ainsi que du numéro de VIN pour envoyer à Ana. Puis vous repartez sans votre voiture. Celle-ci reste garée au port, portes verrouillées à cle. Les clés sont confiées à un employé du port. Il n'y a jamais eu de problème. \r\n\r\n2-3- TIP \r\n\r\nEnviron 2 jours ouvrés plus tard, la douane aura produit le TIP. De son côté, Ana aura souscrit pour vous une assurance SOAT pour pouvoir conduire durant 1 mois en Colombie (le prix est compris dans ce que vous lui paierez). Vous aurez RDV dans un restaurant pas loin du port avec un agent de la société d'ana pour signer le TIP. \r\n\r\n2.3- Paiement et récupération du véhicule. \r\n\r\n- Le lendemain (ou pas loin), vous aurez RDV d'abord aux bureaux d'Ana pour la payer. Ça se situe au Sud du port, et il est nécessaire de prendre un Uber car c'est loin et pas facile à trouver. \r\n\r\n- Puis direction le port, toujours en tenue longue, pour récupérer votre véhicule. Quelques signatures de papiers, et c'est fini!!! Vous êtes prêts à attaquer l'Amérique du Sud.\r\n\r\nEn espérant que le tutoriel vous aide à votre tour.

There is a tap outside for water. Baños at the service station next door - we think a shower too but we didn’t use it.\r\n\r\nNot very private as there is a little road to the village with quite a few people walking by but all friendly and no one came in the night.","location":{"latitude":8.263748485670195,"longitude":-81.97709965430742},"category":{"name":"Informal Campsite"}},{"id":278531,"name":"Aduana Changuinola","date_verified":"2024-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","description":"This is the headquarter of the Aduana in Bocas del toro province. This is the only place where you can extend your TIP in the region. They have lunch break from 12pm to 1pm. You will need to show proof of insurance for the additional month, which you may get at the border or possibly in Changuinola (not sure, got mine in David already). Extending takes 10min and is free. To get here by bus: Coming from Almirante take a bus to Changuinola and change there to a bus toward the border or if possible take one directly from Almirante to the border. All buses from Changuinola to the border stop at an immigration checkpoint shortly past the Aduana office. Get off the bus at the checkpoint, show your passport and tell the officers that you need to go to the Aduana. Walk back 200m to find the Aduana office to the right. Save yourself a long day and many buses that I went through and go directly here. Do not go to the old marker in Changuinola Centro that also pops up on google when you search for Aduana as there is no Aduana office. Also do not go the border at Sixaola because they can only issue TIP but not extend it.","location":{"latitude":9.4662413,"longitude":-82.5538565},"category":{"name":"Customs and Immigration"}},{"id":279113,"name":"Speed Trap Asking for Cash","date_verified":"2024-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Slightly further north on this road (coordinates not exact) there is a 40 zone on a steep downhill. Police were waiting at the bottom to catch us speeding. They told us they could “help us out” by having us pay $50 cash to them. We insisted on a formal ticket and said we were fine to pay at the station. The police said they couldn’t enter a formal ticket because their machine didn’t have cell signal. We held out long enough, pretending not to understand and speaking broken Spanish, that they eventually let us go. I think insisting that we needed the formal ticket “for our insurance”, and therefore wanted to pay at the station, helped our case. Even if they didn’t let us go, would much rather pay a formal ticket than encourage police to target tourists for cash.","location":{"latitude":9.014733333333334,"longitude":-82.2802},"category":{"name":"Checkpoint"}},{"id":280132,"name":"Materiales y suministros, Menéndez","date_verified":"2024-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","description":"We had several problems on our big truck.
