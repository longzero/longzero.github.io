Beautiful, calm and wind protected. From experience we can confirm that there are catfish in the lake and billions of mosquitoes in the air. Should you feel like having a bit of tag-and-release fun follow the next few steps:\r\n1. Find the exact spot and park up. \r\n2. Walk towards the beach and find a suitable green flexible gumtree branch to serve as a fishing rod. \r\n3. Tie on very short amount of discarded line + hook found at a previous wild camp. \r\n4. Put your camping chair next to the lake and make sure all the legs are on a solid surface and not in a gigantic pot hole (also from previous experience!) \r\n5. Stand up. Dust yourself off and reposition your chair. \r\n6. Pour a wine/crack a beer.\r\n7. Smile! Life is good! \r\n8. Prepare the ultimate irresistible catfish bait: take a golf ball sized chunk of fresh local white bread, douse it your favourite beer (ours is Patricia as Uruguayan catfish prefer Uruguayan beer) and start kneading until you have a play dough like consistency. \r\n9. Work the bread on to your hook and make sure to expose a tiny part of the point. \r\n10. Before you cast your line approximately 1.5m off the bank make sure to tie a piece of rope to the end of your branch to prevent loss of fishing gear and looking like a total loser in general. \r\n11. Ask your girlfriend super kindly to fix you another beer, (blissfully unaware at this stage that she will in fact catch twice as many catfish as you) \r\n12. Reap the rewards of your hard work and gently lift the massive catfish out of the water before you even finish your first cigarette. \r\n13. Make sure to hold the fish as far forward as possible for the Kodak moment. It looks WAY bigger! \r\n14. Release the fish and post your catfish selfie. I think mine is bigger than yours \r\n","location":{"latitude":-34.46972,"longitude":-57.8025},"category":{"name":"Wild Camping"}},{"id":91787,"name":"San Luis woods","date_verified":"2023-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","description":"San Luis is a small and quiet village along the Ruta 19.

Uruguay Ferry to/from Argentina","date_verified":"2024-04-03T00:00:00.000Z","description":"The ferry operators are: Buquebus, Colonia Express, Seacat Colonia\r\n\r\n* Ferry Selection and Vehicle Height Considerations *\r\n\r\nIt's crucial to be aware of the height of your vehicle when selecting a ferry service. For instance, Colonia Express has a height limit of 2.1 meters, and vehicles taller than this, like a 2.25-meter van, may be refused. In contrast, Buquebus does not have such strict height limits, accommodating vehicles up to 3 meters in height. This makes Buquebus a more suitable option for larger vehicles, despite potential issues with fitting on smaller vessels and the terminal's limited capacity for big rigs. Note: booking online with Buquebus is not possible for higher vehicles. \r\n\r\nMost people with larger vehicles prefer taking the bridge at Fray Bentos with a 500 km detour.\r\n\r\n* Ticket Purchase and Payment Options *\r\n\r\nTickets can be purchased online or at the terminal. Paying in Argentine Pesos at the Buquebus terminal can be more cost-effective than other options. It's recommended to buy tickets directly at the counter, as it can be cheaper, and payment can be made using credit cards like Mastercard. \r\n\r\n* Pre-Departure Procedures * \r\n\r\nArriving at the ferry terminal in advance (about 1.5 hours before departure) is advised. Before boarding, you need to park your vehicle in the designated waiting line, check in at the desk, and handle necessary formalities like canceling the Temporary Import Permit (TIP) for Uruguay.  The staff is friendly and explains what you need to do.\r\n\r\nPassengers need to wait in the terminal while drivers wait in the vehicles. They will rejoin after departure. \r\n\r\n* Immigration and Customs *\r\n\r\nImmigration processes for both Uruguay and Argentina are conducted simultaneously at the terminal. Ensure you have all necessary documents, including passports and vehicle paperwork. \r\n\r\nArgentinian TIP is issued on the other side.\r\n\r\nFor more details see the other marker on iOverlander: \"Customs and immigration (ferry to/from Argentina)\" in the Customs and immigration category.","location":{"latitude":-34.47383,"longitude":-57.84391},"category":{"name":"Vehicle Shipping"}},{"id":268976,"name":"La Chacra Holandesa","date_verified":"2024-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","description":"The Chacra Holandesa is offering to take your used propane gas bottles free of charge.
