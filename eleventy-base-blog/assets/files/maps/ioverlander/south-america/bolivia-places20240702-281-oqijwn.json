The reason for this is that at the moment there is too much water. When I asked her if we could just follow the dozens of tour cars she said that they are not allowed to take us. The only way we are allowed to go is (oh wonder) with a guide who is here at the entrance of the salar.

Form there just continue the main road until you reach the first river crossing (could be dry, approx. 10km from town). Turn left just before the riverbed. You will pass a sawmill and two farm houses on your left until you reach at the end of the road Sarahs property. Be aware that the road can be really muddy after rainy days. We decided to turn around and walk. But with dry weather it is suitable for all kinds of cars (bumby road though) or you go anytime with your 4x4.\n\nShe has a really nice property in the rainforest. The family has an Amish background but is really open minded and we were surprised to have such a good talk with them. Normally she offers a 4 days stay but you can stay just for one night (like us) or as long as you want. Price is 300 p.P/night including breakfast, lunch and dinner. We were in a room with a double and a single bed. And there was another room like this.\nWe went to the closed by mirador (1 hour hiking in the mountains). You can also visit waterfalls (one way 2,5 hours) or a lake inbetween the mountains. We also went \"fisihing\" in the fishing ponds to get our fish for breakfast. I think horse riding is avaible too and some other things.\nThe family also looks for helpers so if you are interested in working with an Amish family you can ask Sarah.

Him and his mechanics found (and fixed) things that were previously undetected by many other mechanics (both in Bolivia and Chile).

Below freezing temperatures occur at night year round. \r\n-The entire route is dirt roads and tracks across the desert. There are many route options, some of which are on OSM and some are not. \r\n-Fuel consumption will be higher than normal due to road conditions and elevation, some travellers report up to double normal fuel consumption. \r\n-There are two main route options: Uyuni to San Pedro de Atacama, Chile. The distance between fuel stops on this route is about 300km from Alota, Bolivia to San Pedro. The other option is the full SW Circuit, ending in Tupiza, Boliva. The distance from Alota to Tupiza is 600-800km depending on route taken and sites visited. \r\n-The washboard roads are likely to be the worst you have ever experienced. Additionally, tour Landcruisers travelling at high speed turn the road into ruts with a large hump in the middle, even high clearance vehicles may need to drive with caution. Strong/reliable suspension and cautious driving are key to a successful trip. While 2wd low clearance vehicles have occasionally made the journey, strongly consider if this is something you want to attempt if you are driving such a vehicle.\r\n-There is a 150 BOB pp fee to enter the park, and you may encounter community peajes along the way. \r\n\r\nSee comments for individual experiences.

It is a steep and large waterfall (in cascades) with plenty of water and nice views.\r\nIt is 30km one way drive to the falls from the turn-off from Coroico to Caranavi road and you should calculate around 150 min/2,5hr to drive there and back plus some extra time to walk to the falls plus eventually picknick.\r\nDetails: On the way (from Taipiplaya follow the blue street signs 'Cascade Rincon del Tigre') there is a checkpoint were you have to pay 2BOL per vehicle entrance fee. Proceeding from there is in some parts a steep and also narrow rough track. From the checkpoint it is about 20 to 30 min (10km) to come here. There is not much space at the end of this dead-end road and turning the vehicle could be tricky if longer then 6m. We would not recommend to go there with large or heavy vehicles (at least at the moment). They are currently developing this place with a banjo and a small shop (planned entrance fee for the access to the falls is 5BOL pp) but at the time of writing it was still under construction (July 2017). So may be one day they will also improve the track to here.\r\nFrom the parking spot there is a narrow and steep walk starting behind the building. After about 15 minutes walking you come to a junction. The upper left way leads to a lookout at the base of the first visible step of the waterfall. There is quite some water spray in the air but no direct access to the water. The lower right way leads to a nice picknick area with views and onwards to another nice lookout. There is also no easy access to the water. Some steep paths might get you there (we didn't try) but it is nothing for a swim.

There are also lots of other options that you can choose during the trip depending on your interests. Just talk to them. They are highly flexible. Or check on tripadvisor.\nThe lodges are build with traditional materials, clean and very comfortable, the food is authentic and delicious.\nMashaquipe is run by indigenous locals and some of the guides really lived in the jungle for years before they had to leave the area when Madidi-Nationalparc was established. So they know the places by heart. The profit goes back to the local communities and supports indigenous families.\nWe did the 6 days/5 nights tour (3 for jungle and 2 for pampas) and we had a great time by walking or going by boat learing about the stunning diversity of plants, animals and natural medicine.","location":{"latitude":-14.4426,"longitude":-67.52973},"category":{"name":"Tourist Attraction"}},{"id":38818,"name":"Turn-Off to Gruta de San Pedro","date_verified":"2017-07-13T00:41:38.358Z","description":"Leave the main road between Sorata and Mapiri at this point downhill towards San Pedro Community and follow the track for about 1km.

Easy hike if acclimated (only 200 meters of altitude gain). Gorgeous lake in front of Condoriri.\nSeveral options from there.\n- To the right up and you enter an other valley which leads you back down or at the col to the left and you head straight to the first mountain.\n- Around the lake where you find behind another small one and the obvious track brings you to a glacier in 400 meters. Very easy walk. If continuing the trail around the lagoon it goes up to the Paso Chakoti (5.152 m). Around 4.2 km and 500 meters gain (without walking to the small lake and the glacier). The last bit was very strength-sapping.\n- If you turn left at lagoon Chiar Khota you can hike straight up to the col. Maybe a bit more than a km less then.\nUp at the Paso one can hike 200 meters of elevation more to reach the summit of Pico Austria. As my heart was racing I skipped it.\nDownhill and back was it slightly longer: Until the end of Laguna Juri Khota the track is easy to find, lots of loose gravel and rocks. Afterwards I wasn't able to follow the track. Nothing clear... Opened OSM and realized I had to hike up a hill again. Juri Khota is at 4,700 (and I walked first down into the valley) the col was at almost 4,900. Very hard to go uphill over clumps of grass without track. I found it up there and lost it again later, already in sight of Laguna Tuni. Headed towards the lake and was after almost 28 km back at start.\nMagnificent but be aware it will be a long day.\n\nThe street to get to Tuni is a toll road. 5 BOL per car, cashed in Chunavi.

The one we took continued at its end (walk a bit to the right) on an old gravel road. Hike up and more and more beautiful views over this stunning landscape will appear. Also up there are several trails and one can spend a day hiking through the individual gulches and find rock pinnacles, a bit similar to stuff we have seen in Arizona.\nAlso great views over La Paz to one side and Illimani to the other.\nThere must be another way to the Valle de las Animas as well, but through road works we couldn’t drive that direction.\n\nValle de la Luna was ok, but this was free, we were alone and the landscape was much more fascinating!

Bring a full tank and plenty of cash. 100bs entrance per person for the National Park - kids under 12 free. To hire a guide is 100bs total therefore you can split this cost with a group. If you don't want a guide, ask the park ranger where you can go without one. Not many places though. Would highly recommend the services of a guide.

We had thought it was the thermostat, but knew it could also be due to dust from the roads in Beni and/or the steep inclines at altitude. Rather than leading us into a repair we didn't need, he worked with us to pinpoint the issue and repair it. The service was honest, efficient and well priced. We asked him to change our oil and oil filter while we were there as we were nearly due for this, and he cleaned both our air filter and fuel filter as well, at no extra cost. While we were there, we also took advantage of the chaperia service and had our rear bumper repaired - an old injury from the previous owner.\n\nRolando has lived in the UK and completed mechanical training in both the UK and North America.. He is a motor enthusiast who loves car racing and also restoring bikes and go-carts.. He is such a nice guy and he prides himself in providing a fair and honest service. What a great find, definitely recommended!\n\n\ncotacota calle 3, entre alvares Plata y retamas callejon al medio nro 30\nTel: 77266683\nEmail: profix657@gmail.com","location":{"latitude":-16.543377,"longitude":-68.062132},"category":{"name":"Mechanic and Parts"}},{"id":44930,"name":"AVEX 4x4","date_verified":"2017-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","description":"many parts avalaible here and accessories of good value including ARB and Engel\nfriendly and helpful staff, speaking good English\nservicing and mechanics also possible","location":{"latitude":-17.751035,"longitude":-63.190794999999994},"category":{"name":"Mechanic and Parts"}},{"id":45028,"name":"No name.

See pins at the turnoff on 701 as well as the pin in Uyuni “Preparation for Lagunas Route” for information on the commonly travelled route from Uyuni - San Pedro de Atacama, Chile. \r\n\r\nThis pin focuses on the route between Tupiza and Laguna Colorado, where you can head south to San Pedro or north to Uyuni. See comments for individual experiences. Here is what you need to know: \r\n-The entire route is mainly over 4000m elevation, often approaching 5000m. Below-freezing temperatures at night will be encountered throughout the year.\r\n-Road conditions vary widely depending on season and maintenance. The route is heavily travelled by tour Landcruisers running heavy-duty agricultural tires at high speeds. Because of this, the washboarding of the roads is epic, and ruts form with a hump in the middle that may be 50cm tall. Even high clearance vehicles need to drive with care to avoid dragging differentials and belly pans. Travel speeds may be as low as 10-15km/hr at times. Confidence in your vehicle is key. \r\n-Unlike much of the classic Lagunas route, most of which is in wide open valleys, the 300km route from Tupiza to Quetena Chico is on shelf roads cut into the hillsides. Not a big deal in dry conditions, but in wet season (which includes snow) they turn into incredibly slippery clay mud and will be treacherous for even the most capable 4x4 driver and vehicle. There are also at least a dozen river crossings along this route, which are inconsequential in dry season but may pose serious challenges in wet season.\r\n-The distance from Tupiza to Thermas de Polques or Laguna Colorada is approx 350km, entirely dirt roads. The nearest reliable fuel from there is Alota, Boliva on the 701, or San Pedro de Atacama, Chile. Depending on route choice, distance between fuel stations may be 600-800 km. Fuel consumption will be higher than normal due to elevation and road condition. Some diesel vehicles consume double normal rate. \r\n-There are a couple of community peajes along the way, and the 150 BOB pp fee to enter the park. \r\n\r\nIf you’re prepared, this will be the drive of a lifetime.

The breakfast was amazing (they can make pancakes for you and they are filled with honey, strawberries, nuts, granola, banana) and the staff was also so nice and eager to help us.

However the north is more beautiful and has a complete infrastructure to receive tourists (before the boycott that started two years ago the north was receiving most visitors).\r\n\r\nHere we tell you how we managed to visit Challapampa and its surroundings in the north:\r\n\r\n1. In Copacabana at the Plaza Sucre where all the buses to La Paz leave is a small agency called 'Turismo Comunitario del Lago Titicaca'. -16.1655688, -69.0879274\r\nThis agency sells tickets for the community boat that goes 3 times a week to Challapampa (Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday). We got a one-way ticket for Saturday for 35 bolivianos. The boat leaves at 1 pm in Copacabana and arrives around 3 pm in Challapampa. We were the only tourists on the boat. Further a local of the community will accompany you, answer questions and help you to find a hospedaje (you'll want to stay at least one night on the island).\r\n2. On the island: After we arrived we found an good hostel to stay on the beach (Wilka Kutti), left our stuff there and walked to the Inkan ruins in the north (Mesa Sagrada and Chinkana). Also experienced a great sunset over the lake Titicaca. Back in Challapampa we ate a great soup at the restaurant 'Q'uimsa Bolivia'. As there are almost no tourists most restaurants are closed.\r\n3. Return to Copacabana: You can leave Challapampa by boat only Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 07:30 am. Another option is to walk to the south of the island (beautiful 8 km walk, take the Inkan steps over the top!). In Yumani there are a lot of tourist boats that take you for 20 bolivianos back to Copacabana (leave around 3 pm).","location":{"latitude":-16.16558983,"longitude":-69.08787842},"category":{"name":"Tourist Attraction"}},{"id":91803,"name":"Modern gas station","date_verified":"2019-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Here we got 40 L of gasoline 'Especial' for local price with factura in our jerrycans (150 bolivianos).

If you take this detour from Santa Elena to Loma Alta (near Rurrenabaque) you will see, and be truly surrounded by, real jungle. When i was there i think i saw around 10,000+ butterflies. I was told this is normal, though I'm not sure the guy i was speaking to realised quite how many there were out there. You will hear many birds, but i didn't really see too many. Saw a few Badger sized things of various shapes, no idea what.\r\n\r\nThe roads are marked fairly accurately on maps.me, though were wrong in a few places. If you find yourself on the wrong path ask a local (everyone was helpful and gave good directions) or follow your nose, you'll probably end up back on the blue line.\r\n\r\nThere is (apparently) one alojamiento on the route in Bernardino. The gas stations are about 500km apart, but there are tiendas selling basic things, they may have fuel, they definitely have shotgun shells. I bought fuel in the village marked by this pin i think. I bought lunch at one of the tiendas, but don't count on being able to buy a cooked meal.\r\n\r\nThis pin is marked at the start of the route, where I've marked the ferry near riberalta is the end, you might be able to go further though.\r\n\r\nThe road is mostly pretty good, but narrow. There are various times when there were deep ruts from when it's been muddy, so you'd probably need good ground clearance. I did see a normal Peugeot 306 on the road, but it was missing it's bumper.

The Ruta Nacional 5 going south from Uyuni is an unpaved dirt road of decent quality. It leads into Ruta 701 which is also a dirt road of mixed quality. They seem to be currently building a better road (701) which causes a lot of detours into gravel fields (July 2019).\r\nUnfortunately there was a storm briefly hitting the area the day before which was accompanied by some, but not too much rain. The road turned into a field of mud at these coordinates and all busses and trucks got stuck. Since the road was blocked the other cars took a side road which was equally muddy but not blocked. We dared to cross in our front wheel drive minivan and it was terrible. Only with the help of some poor stranded bus passengers we managed to work through the mud in five hours. The mud problem was very local and limited to a two or three kilometer stretch. Afterwards the road was not great but ok. 4x4s seemed to be doing fine if the skills of the driver were matching the cars capabilities. Most got through without any problem, some struggled too. I believe that this problem only arises after some rain (doesn't need to be pouring!) so I would recommend to ask locals in Uyuni about the condition if you suspect a problem. But if you make it to Chile you will be rewarded with an awesome paved highway and almost perfect infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe first photo shows Ruta 5 right after Uyuni, the second shows the mud field.

It’s a bit narrow, there are a few turns with fallen stones to drive on and there are few dry river beds with high steps to pass but with our 4x4 Toyota Hillux we got through it quite easily. \r\n\r\nOnce you pass Viru Viru, going to Rio San Pedro (and eventually Carasi) the road gets really really bad. \r\n\r\nThere are 3 barriers, made of tree trunks of different sizes. It took us a bit of time and a lot of energy but took them apart and continued. \r\n\r\nBut after that, the road got narrower, and it was impossible to even turn around to go back. \r\n\r\nThe mountains’ walls are very friable and there were loads of super big fallen stones (50/60kg) and dead tree trunks on the path. We actually had to break/carry/push them around so we could pass (because we could not turn around) which was very difficult, and strenuous not to mention dangerous. \r\n\r\nWe finally reached and crossed the bridge. \r\n\r\nBut after the bridge, the road to Carasi is simply impractical for cars, there is only space for motorcycles or bikes. According to maps.me you could go through the river bed, however we tried it on foot and there were a lot of very big stones and the ground was very soft, so there is a high risk of getting stuck even with a 4x4. \r\n\r\nAs there is absolutely no one there (no cars, no people) we recommend NOT to try it or at least not in the rainy season and if possible not alone. \r\n\r\nWe turned around on the bridge and got back to Sucre as there was no way to continue. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","location":{"latitude":-18.383612,"longitude":-65.652794},"category":{"name":"Warning"}},{"id":124973,"name":"Quiet field not far from the road ","date_verified":"2020-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Big field near the road. \r\nGood alternative to villages’ main squares. \r\nPartially hidden and very quiet (traffic dies down after 9pm).

On today’s ride I saw no formal accommodation after departing El Alto, although there must have been places between 11.2 and 23 km.

At Pongo (51.2 km) one could apparently also camp for free, at the church several km off-route down in the valley. Thereafter there was only wild camping.

Today there were several places to camp on the Death Road. Camping was free except at the end, at Albergue Yolosa, where it cost 10 BOB ($1.50) pp. In the village at 1.0 km was a large open space for camping, with bathroom and water faucet. One had to walk 20 m for views. At 3.9 km was a clearing with space for several tents (photo). No water. Good views. At 20.8 km (Mono Zipline) cyclists could camp under cover in the outdoor seating area (photo). This place had bathrooms and water. Good views.\r\n\r\nI stayed at Albergue Yolosa for 1 night. This hotel was relatively new and was a community-owned project. Clearly they were still learning how to run a hotel. Price for my ensuite matrimonial room was 70 BOB ($10) or nearly 2x that of my room in Coroico, yet it was of inferior value. This room had space for my bike. (There were tiny rooms for 40 BOB).  I felt it worthwhile to help the community. The standard may improve once more people come and stay. The alternatives were expensive accommodation at Senda Verde and at one other upscale hotel up the river from Yolosa. (This I did not visit. I was told about it by a villager).\r\n\r\nPros: large pleasant courtyard with table and seating. Ensuite. Large plastic table and plastic chair (upon request). At 70 BOB it was the cheapest accommodation option in Yolosa. One could camp for 10 BOB pp. Cons: no TP, towel or soap. On-demand hot shower suffered from intermittent water flow so one had to turn in nearly full on for the heating element to work. The temperature was then too low to be pleasant. Instead I boiled a liter of water and used this to wash myself. Bed sagged in the middle and was a bit short, such that my feet pressed against the end. (I am 5 ft 11\"). Lighting was rather dim.

At my destination, Pongo, I was given permission by a friendly lady, Lucy to camp in the open soccer field 30 m below her tienda (no bathrooms but lots of bushes), or inside the covered bus shelter next to her tienda. I chose the latter, as it was threatening rain. The shelter had a roof and 4 walls, with an open doorway. It was 2 x 3 m inside. It was large enough of my 2-person tent and two bikes. Log seat on long side.\r\n\r\nThis was a good camp spot. Pros: I had shelter from the wind and rain, and a seat inside on a log. I could lock my rear wheel to a pole inside the hut. I found a square 0.7 m long brick chimney outside, which I rolled inside and used as a table for my laptop. There was a secluded wooded area on the north side for a potty hole. There was  a water faucet on N. side of school, 10m from Lucy's tienda. See photo. There were 2 small tiendas nearby (bread, UHT milk, junk food). Cons: it was fairly busy from early morning to late evening. Many buses and trucks stopped by.

On today’s ride from Pongo, there were a few possible wild camps en route. In Huañacota, I had intended camping in an abandoned mud hut with 4 walls but no roof. However, I happened to stop at a water faucet at the first new house on the left, and the owner Porfirio came out to chat. He said I could camp inside his old mud hut opposite. This had 4 walls, a roof and a door. It was a much better and warmer camp spot than my intended one (above), especially after Porfirio had rigged me up with a makeshift table and chair. By 17h00 it had begun to snow. I was so glad to be under a roof!\r\n\r\nThis was a good camp spot. Pros: roof, 4 walls and a door provided protection against the snow and a warmer overnight. Enough space for my 2-person tent and 2 bikes. Water faucet opposite. Good stock area out back, with reasonable privacy, for potty holes. Porfirio rigged me up with a chair and a makeshift table. Cons: The doorway was 0.5 m below the street drain which made it tricky to carry my bike in and out. Easier with 2 persons and no panniers.\r\nNote: to ask permission to camp here.

Christobal offered a room in his home, which I gladly accepted. Note: the Municipal Building was being remodeled and they said it too would offer camping in the future. Ask folk in the plaza.\r\n\r\nThis worked out OK and was much better than camping outside where I estimate it reached -5C. I was grateful to Christobal for inviting me to camp inside his main room. Pros: space for my tent, gear and bike (2 bikes possible). Table and chair for updating my blog. Lighting and 220V outlet for electronics and boiling water. Water faucet outside.

On today’s ride, there was free camping at the Mirador (16.1 km, S21.35908 W68.02614). I saw no other official camp area, but the wild country after 21.6 km offered many places. I had intended continuing to Laguna Hedionda, but when I arrived at Laguna Cañapa I was so enchanted with the beauty of the place that I decided to wild camp there. No camping was allowed near the Laguna. The local guard said I could camp about 1 km to the west, in front of a ridge. There was a smooth sandy space for 1 tent, which was flat enough. This faced E with good views so it would catch the early morning sun (which it did, at 07h10 the next day). No charge to camp.\r\n\r\nToday I wild camped at 36.9 km. Turnoff from the laguna's main gravel road was at about 36.4 km onto gravel track up a slope on right. I stayed here for 1 night.  \r\n\r\nI much enjoyed this wild camp. Pros: I had it all to myself. I awoke to the soft light over the mountaintops and the Laguna. I felt completely at peace with the world in this scenic place. Cons: ground was a little sloping.\r\n\r\nWater: The Mirador (16.1 km) had meals, drinks and water for sale, at high prices. I stopped here for a 2-course vegetarian lunch (35 BOB).

Starting from Tupiza, climbing Uturunku (6008m), Lagunas Route and then Salar de Uyuni and back to tupiza in a 4x4.\r\n\r\nThe whole experience was 10/10. They also got us a safe place to store our camper for free and let us use the toilet and shower in the hostel. \r\n\r\nBasically they were the only company in Tupiza with good website and reliable information - route, conditions, prices, - and had the best reviews on TripAdvisor and Google. They were super responsive and spoke fluent English!\r\n\r\nWe communicated with Carlos and Roberto and they were very flexible and attentive. They also have a hostel in the centre of Tupiza and know many places around if you ever need anything.\r\n\r\nAlso when we spoke with the guides they told us that La Torre Tours has been the best company for many years - being fair, paying regularly and having like 15 guides constantly employed - so you know you really get the best standard.\r\n\r\nSo our tour - it was really well organized and we always felt safe and comfortable. Like you do get into some super remote places, but with a nice big 4x4 Toyota Land Cruiser and a very experienced driver (we went with Roberto Gutiérrez) with more 10 years of experience we always felt safe and on top of things.\r\n\r\nAccomodation was basic but ok, food was also basic but tasty and enough, and places along the route were crazy beautiful - one of the prettiest we've ever seen.\r\n\r\nUturunku was hard because of the altitude but local guide Marcos was friendly and knowledgeable and we all made it to the top! \r\n\r\nAnd now our driver Roberto - also 10/10. He really knew his car, knew the ways, cooked and took care of us always. Always would he stop whenever we wanted for pictures or toilet or whatsoever. Also he explained a lot about every place we visited. And he was funny and in good relations with other guides along the route and would always get us the best rooms in accomodations etc... Like he was always driving pretty slow and safe - we saw a lot of cars on the way that were going way to fast for those conditions. And we heard people have died in this Uyuni tours mainly because of drunk and fast drivers. So it really makes sense to fo with a reliable agency.\r\n\r\nSo really, the whole thing was beyond our expectations and for this price it's really a bargain you're getting. I absolutely recommend this agency and Roberto in particular. Ask for him if you can. \r\n\r\nJust one thing to beware - you're almost constantly above 4000m, sleeping on 4400 sometimes - so you should be acclimatized a bit or prepared for the altitude, it's still a stress for your body 😊","location":{"latitude":-21.4455721,"longitude":-65.718634},"category":{"name":"Tourist Attraction"}},{"id":217185,"name":"Outside the road F4","date_verified":"2023-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Big space for camping at the entry of a wild forest.

As all of the agencies hire like 7 lodges in the same area and do the same stuff. Level of comfort seemed pretty much the same. \r\n\r\nWe did planned activities like sunset bar, piranha fishing, anaconda hunt and swimming with dolphins. \r\n\r\nAnimals - we saw a lot of them. There are also 3 or 4 (1 really big,) caimans hanging just around the lodge. So many birds, monkeys (3 different species), turtles, dolphins... Well worth it.\r\n\r\nAnaconda - we went to a little island with other groups to search for anaconda. Guides found one and then they forcefully pulled it by the tail and caught it, so some turists could take pictures. Our guide wasn't a part of this and was sad by what was going on. But apparently not much fan be changed, I don't know. \r\n\r\nMosquitoes were like crazy - biting through our thick hiking trousers as well! So really get good maybe army pants and put a towel or something on your chair below your butt and back, so they can't sting you from behind - will already make a big difference. Also take thick socks.\r\n\r\nThere are no soft drinks or beer at the lodge, so bring your own if you need to. Food was good and enough.\r\n\r\nOur guide was Jose and he was a really cool guy.

For the start, we had bought a beer and yes, drinking in public is illegal in Bolivia. This is what they used to pick up on us. \r\nBy two masked officers we were made sit on the sidewalk for about an hour. Then we were put in a civil car, not a police car, and taken to a police station nearby. Even though we were driven around the city for a long time. At the police station we were put in a cell and after a while seperately informed that it would be eight hours of detention and social work or we could pay a \"fine\" and leave. It was said to be 500 BOBs. We had to sign a prefabricated statement and put our fingerprint under it. I was not allowed to read it. We were not told the names of the officers who had arrested us, nor were we given a copy of the statement, a ticket or anything in writing. \r\nI had only 460 BOBs in cash but that seemed to be enough as well. I could leave and walk back.\r\nDetainee number four did not have any money on him. He said he would stay the eight hours. During the night he was brought to the head of the station several times. Every time asking lower amounts of money. Moreover, he was not allowed to sleep. Anytime he fell asleep an officer put a bright flashlight in his eyes. Sleep deprivation is internationally regarged as torture.\r\nDuring the night more tourists kept on \"arriving\". The same show. Seems to be a business modell with the Santa Cruz Police. \r\nIn the morning he was allowed to leave. \r\n\r\n When in Santa Cruz or Bolivia in general be extremely careful around the police. The police force seems to be highly corrupt - see the other warnings in ioverlander - and targeting tourists. Do not give them anything to pick up on.","location":{"latitude":-17.77913,"longitude":-63.1819},"category":{"name":"Warning"}},{"id":235148,"name":"Parking and BBQ of Chorro de San Louis","date_verified":"2023-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Amazing waterfall and pool about 15 minutes from parking.

He made the entire day just perfect. His English helped us feel comfortable, his humor and good nature made all of it very fun.  \r\nThe two of them took care of us like family and loved our dog, Pacha as if she was theirs.   \r\nThe tour included a traditional lunch on the Salar.

The table setting was beautiful and added to the special ambiance.  \r\nDuring the hikes and stops, David was patient with our old, slow walking and yet captured beautiful photos of every opportunity.

This includes return transport from La Paz, breakfast, snacks, and at the end of the journey lunch with access to a swimming pool and showers. we had a French guide: Maxime who can talk to you at length about Bolivia. the tour lasts approximately from 7:15 a.m. until 8 p.m. we may have been privileged because we were alone with the guide, but otherwise there is approximately one guide for a maximum of 10 people. you can ride at your own pace as there are regular breaks. If your physical condition is good, absolutely do this tour, it’s great!
