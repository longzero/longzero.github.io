The side the Toilet is on is best recommended for big Rigs as there is a bigger turning circle area; the opposite side is suitable for Caravans and tents.\r\n\r\nBecause of the junction of the Peel River and Swamp Creek the water levels have been seen to rise quickly and the Tamworth Regional Council has advised of flash flooding in the area.\r\n\r\nThe area is well known for gold and gemstone fossicking and plenty of time can be spent in the water way panning for Gold. The local town of Nundle offers plenty of tourist attractions. The Woolen mill is a must for Australian Grown and Made Woolen products from yarn to clothing. The socks are even made right here at Nundle and a tour of the woolen mills is very informative.\r\n\r\nSITE ACCESS\r\nIf leaving from Tamworth travel towards Nundle. The reserve can be accessed from either end of Rivers Road. The road is gravel, if coming from Nundle the distance is 2Km.\r\n\r\nFEES \u0026 BOOKINGS\r\nThere is no charge for the use of this facility at the moment, so if you are staying at this site we encourage you to help keep it clean, and please visit and support the nearest town or village.\r\n\r\nTHINGS TO DO\r\nIn the closest town Nundle there are two antique stores, a homewares store, small grocers and takeaway shop, post office, Craft markets, op shop, leather shop, leadlight shop and classes, Café and Hotel.\r\n\r\nThe pool and playground are a hit with the kids. If you travel 11 Km east from Nundle to Sheba dams reserve you can swim, fossick, fish or just relax beside the water. There is also the Arc-En-Ciel Trout farm past the Sheba dams, fossicking for precious stones is also a fun way to pass the time.\r\n\r\nFACILITIES\r\nThe Reserve is serviced by the local council. There are rubbish bins and a long drop windy toilet.\r\nA large undercover area with table and chairs is very good if it is raining.\r\nDrinking water – There is no drinking water.\r\n\r\nRULES\r\nDogs are permitted on a lead and campfires are allowed following fire restrictions.\r\n\r\n","location":{"latitude":-31.435774,"longitude":151.1423979},"category":{"name":"Wild Camping"}},{"id":71660,"name":"Gregories","date_verified":"2018-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Lovely campsite in the Francois Peron National Park.

Massive granite boulders perch high above the valley’s deep, calm pools and the swelling river rapids offer the promise of exciting adventures for intrepid canoeists.\r\nNaturally, most visitors to the park base their exploration of the park around. The park’s sense of peaceful solitude makes it a wonderful spot for long, relaxed bushwalks, birdwatching, nature photography, and self-reliant camping and hiking.\r\nThere’s plenty of space in which to camp and picnic and lots to explore, from the grassy flats beside the river to the towering ridgelines that rise high above it.
