The drive to the Scientific Research cabins is about 3+ hours up the mountain from the town of San Agustin Acasaguastlan. This offroad trail has a technical level of 3 - 5 depending on the season. During the rainy season it can be very challenging and recovery gear most likely will be needed. You'll encounter loose sand, gravel and rocks, muddy spots with deep ruts and narrow stretches with overgrown vegetation. ***4x4, high clearance and recovery gear is a must*** 8.5 ft height max due to overgrown vegetation. Patience is a must. A guide to drive up is a must. $15 (USD) to use cabins $10 (USD) for tent/car camping.

This school is owned by teachers who branched off another school and created their own.  All teachers speak some English, which we have found to be very important. They offer homestays. For us they seemed expensive at first but they are a huge help in continuing to learn the language once you have left class.  We started class knowing very little Spanish and after 4 weeks left being able to maintain a conversation. \r\n\r\nWe took classes for 4 weeks with Selvin and would both highly recommend him as a teacher.  He has a ton of experience was very organized with his material.  Just being a native speaker does not make you a good teacher.  I was obvious that Selvin put a lot of time and energy into how he teaches certain concepts and the language as a whole.\r\n\r\nWe stayed at the home of Julio and Vila (the house of the Black Sheep). We recommend asking for them specifically.  They were incredibly welcoming, friendly, fun and went out of their way to help us learn Spanish.  Vila is hilarious and jokes around a lot. Julio is an English teacher in the local schools. He is also very knowledgable about the history of the Mayan people and the area.  They have two very sweet boys who do a good job helping you with your Spanish. We truly felt like we were part of their family. \r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a place to stop and learn some Spanish we highly recommend this place.

We paid 130Q/night for two, a private room with 2 single beds and shared bathroom. The room with a queen bed was $150Q. Our room was basic but we only slept there. They have shared dorm for 60Q/p. They have much nicer bungalows, some on the river or in the jungle for more $300-450Q/night I believe? Unfortunately all Food is extra, but really freaking good. The breakfast is 30-40Q/person and Lunch is around 45Q/meal, both from a menu. We brought snacks and ate only one meal other than dinner to save some money. The pizza for two for 65$ is the best bang for your buck at lunch. The dinner is 55Q/pp and is a family style meal. (You can ask to not have your meal with everyone) We can sometimes be antisocial but we really loved sitting down and getting to know everyone, the people and food were different every night. You never had to worry about not getting enough. The bread and chimmichurri that comes with dinner is worth it alone. Drinks are also extra. Alcohol was expensive but we smuggled in our own rum 😊. Drinking Water is 3Q for 1L. Out front of the hotel is the river where you can enjoy the sun on the a dock or have fun on the rope swing. Behind the hotel is thick jungle with hiking trails. They have kayak rentals and offered a variety of hiking and kayak tours. We did the hiking on our own, the trails are on maps.me so it was easy. Highly recommend checking out the tiger cave, bring a flashlight. We rented the kayaks for a day and went to Livingston (about 2.5hours) they offer a shuttle back so you don’t have to paddle back up river (for an extra cost, of course). They have a sauna and a hot shower for extra cost, it isn’t much. Cold showers are free 👍 they have a gym and a place to do you own laundry and hang it up, also free. We spent most of our days reading in the hammocks and just enjoying the beautiful scenery and peaceful setting - also for free! \n\nOne final note, the boat from Rio Dulce to Finca Tatin or anywhere on the river is rather expensive. We paid 125Q/p on the way there and 110Q/p on the way back. If I would try and only pay the 110 on the way there. Finca Tatin offers a shuttle for 90q/p but only if they have 6 people, email or call before your arrival and see if they have a boat coming. They have boats to Livingston twice a day so coming or going there is never a problem (not sure of price on that).\n\nUPDATE ON PRICES SEPT 2018: hotel and food prices are all still about the same. Boat to/from Rio Dulce is fixed at 125Qpp each way, whether you get off here or go all the way to Livingston.\n","location":{"latitude":15.787516666666667,"longitude":-88.80106666666667},"category":{"name":"Hotel"}},{"id":52282,"name":"Cascada termal - hot Spring waterfall  (+informal campsite)","date_verified":"2023-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Tourist attraction as well as a camping place.

I boiled my brake fluid while going down this road.   I have a 5 speed automatic but the problem is that the grade is too steep to allow first gear alone to slow you down enough to make the snake-like hairpins, as brake utilization will be mandatory, particularly on the last stretch of the road into Panajachel.   I also carry an infrared \"gun thermometer\" to check the plates of the rotors.   An additional problem is on the steepest stretch of this road, there is no place to pull out and allow the rotors to cool.   My rotors were at around 500F when the fluid boiled and I lost all braking capability but luckily at a location at the very bottom of the hill when they completely went out.   A few minutes more the the damage would have been horrible.  What I do through Guatemala while descending extremely steep grades that the transmission with not slow enough is to stop every 5 minutes and check the rotor temps.   As they reach near 400F, I allow them to cool down into the 180F or so which takes normally 10-15 minutes.   Then I begin the descent again, stopping every 5 minutes and rest and cool again as I approach 400F.   A normal transmission will not slow you down enough to make the hair pin turns on such a steep grade.   So if you decide to take this road, proceed with caution.

We took the main road through the town, making a small detour where the road was damaged.  Following a rough (but manageable in 2 wheel drive) dirt road we were hoping to find a nice, quiet and flat place to stay for the night.  WE DID!  About 400m from the fork in the road that will take you to the iOverlander spot of Hotel El Olvido there is a large, relatively flat pull off on the left hand side of the road.  You can't miss it.  It looks like the locals use it for a quarry for gravel, because a large part of the mountain has been dug away here. There is a large telephone poll on the top of it. The wind was a nice reprieve from the heat and we had a nice view of the moon rise and the lights of the villages below us.  The road got more traffic than we expected. Several locals drove by in trucks or on motorbikes (and horseback!), but no one stopped by and - more importantly - no one bothered us.  At 7am some cops came by to ask if we were ok, if we needed assistance or if we were bothered.  We said no, that we were fine and that we'd be moving on that morning anyway.  They gave us their card and said if we had any trouble we could give them a call.  4056-4116. The cops in Guatemala and Mexico continue to amaze us!  Be aware, you are in bug country. It was crazy in the morning when we woke up (fine at night with the wind). Make sure you're wearing protection! Big rigs should be fine at the site, but may have trouble squeezing through the town's narrow roads.  No generators please, let's keep this place peaceful.  Of course there is ROOM for tents, but use your discretion.  We were fine, but a tent seems more vulnerable.","location":{"latitude":14.959496666666666,"longitude":-89.886275},"category":{"name":"Wild Camping"}},{"id":85044,"name":"Agua pura Fuente de Vida","date_verified":"2019-02-21T00:00:00.000Z","description":"garafon 20 l for 8 Q. nice people. washed my containers. its a relative small side street, so not possible to get there with big rigs, or maybe rigs at all. but you can park at a very steep street about 20 m away.

Would ask permission first if camping is available. This is the second time we stopped here in two months apart from stays. Dogs are fine. Restaurant with free WiFi inside. A drink or food purchase would be courteous. There is also a panderia (bakery) attached to the restaurant. Very tasty treats!

We have a RDH van (Delica), so this seemed like the best option for us on our way south. This point is the office. 3rd story, gray building above a little pollo restaurant. The contact we went through was Mayden de Ralda. Her WhatsApp number is +502 5698 0994 (normally very quick to respond) and email is maydenderalda@corporacionmenorha.com. Although we got in touch a month in advance, she didn’t need confirmation of what ship we wanted until a week prior to sailing. The correspondence was easy- we sent via WhatsApp a copy of the vehicle title, the TIP, and passports. She sent the schedule for the following 4 weeks, a shipping quote for Seaboard, and the agency quote for themselves. The shipping cost $1003, and agency/port fees $525, so $1528 USD total on the Guatemala side. Our ship was to sail on a Wednesday, so Monday morning we arrived to begin the process, which went as follows.\r\n1. Had everything we wanted to travel with packed up. Once the vehicle is in the port they don’t let you get anything out of it. \r\n2. Arrived at their office (opens at 8:30) wearing long pants and close toed shoes (hiking shoes worked, but with smaller thin shoes they won’t let you in). Met Mayden and she sent us with Ricardo to take the van to the port, just a block away. We left our bags in the office. \r\n3. Took with us our passports, TIP, TIP sticker, and copy of drivers license (can leave it all in the van, it stays with you for a while).\r\n4. Ricardo gave us safety gear to wear and we began the rounds of stopping at several places to do lots of paperwork. He took care of all of it, only needing a few signatures. Because there were 2 of us, only the title holder can drive into the port, so the other person will ride on the back of Ricardo’s moto. There are a few stops to make (entrance, shipping booths, weighbridge, customs...)\r\n5. After all the paperwork and shuffling around was taken care of, we left the car in the “bodega” for the night. Ricardo gave us rides back one by one to the entrance where we turned our badges in, got our passports back, and walked 1 block back to the office.\r\n6. Back at the office, we made our payment to Mayden in cash (4069q). There was some confusion as to how to pay Seaboard, because you don’t do that through Mayden, nor the Seaboard office there. However, you have the option of paying that fee at the destination, which is apparently what most people do, and we will too (in Cartagena). The other option is to have with you the thousand dollars cash or thousand dollars worth of Quetzales in cash to deposit into the seaboard bank account. (I’ll report back how the payment goes on the Colombia side.)\r\n7. I’ll just note, all of this took most of the day. We had a couple minor hiccups, so, efficiently, it could probably be done in a morning.\r\n8. Done for the day, all that was left was to wait to hear from Mayden about what time slot we would get to put the van in the container for the following day. We stayed at a hotel just 5 min walk from the office.\r\n9. We got the 8am slot, so we showed up at about 7:40 to the office and again went to the port with Ricardo to put the van into the awaiting container. The port workers drove it in, strapped it down, and locked it up. Took photos of the container number and seal number. This took less than an hour.\r\n10. Back at the office, we got the final paperwork to take to Colombia, caught a taxi to the Litegua bus station in Puerto Barrios, and got a bus back to the city to catch our flight.\r\n\r\nOverall, there’s nothing to stress about. The only thing I wish I would have known before was that the process takes 2 days. We ALMOST bought flights for Tuesday, but figured we wait a day “in case anything comes up with the shipping.” Good call. Also, Mayden is super nice, she even bought us a big bag of fruit for our bus ride, and Ricardo was an absolute legend flying around the port taking care of everything. Highly recommend shipping with them.\r\n","location":{"latitude":15.690286,"longitude":-88.614668},"category":{"name":"Vehicle Shipping"}},{"id":111232,"name":"Car park next to Shell garage","date_verified":"2019-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Appears to be an overnight truck stop - quiet at night from 10ish but sporadically noisy in early morning when the trucks depart.

I think it was 200Q/night with A/C. \r\nSpotless clean but beware of the ants if you let some food in your room. \r\nEach room has a little terrace with table and/or hammock facing the full-of-birds-and-plants patio.\r\nFast WiFi available everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe game changer for us: the hotel has a little gated parking for 4 cars just in front of the entrance. We could park our van (2,50m high) there. The gate is closed at night and it feels really safe.\r\n\r\nRestaurant on site - count 40Q to 50Q for a main, 30 to 40Q for breakfast. They have really good smoothies too.\r\n\r\nTip: a “señor” comes every day to the restaurant to sell its banana bread and carrot cake. He is there in the morning and often back again around midday. The banana bread is an absolute delight. One whole bread is 30Q. Half a carrot cake is 20Q.\r\n\r\nThe hotel also organized our trip to Tikal. 125Qpp round trip to the site, with a guide onsite. You still have to add the 150Q pp for the reserve entrance. Outbound at 5.30pm, so you are quite alone onsite when you starts the tour.\r\n","location":{"latitude":16.993331,"longitude":-89.691339},"category":{"name":"Hotel"}},{"id":115931,"name":"Hotel Chicago","date_verified":"2024-03-05T09:35:04.000Z","description":"Basic Hotel. \nlocked/secure parking in central area - see photos. \n150q for room with double bed. \nWiFi - yes.

The turn is not marked. Look for a tiendita almost directly North of this gps spot. It’s next to the dirt road where you’ll turn. There’s a ranch house behind the tiendita. At the house the family will charge you to drive through their fincas. We were quoted Q30pp to drive through the fincas to access Crater Azul, Q100 for access + camping (for 2 people), negotiable. The family is very friendly and will answer any questions you have about Crater Azul. You’ll drive through several livestock gates that you’ll have to unlatch and re-latch as you pass. The road is a bit rutted out but we saw a local van make it. High clearance will be helpful, but not necessary. It looks like it’ll get muddy when it rains. Not suitable for big rigs due to the low tree branches and a narrow, wooden plank bridge. We came in a 2.5m tall Toyota Sequoia. Flat, shaded parking spaces, trash cans, a pit toilet (just a hole in the ground) with plastic sheet walls on 3 sides. You can make a fire for grilling; there’s wood around. Crater Azul is actually a spring (not a crater) with crystal clear water. It’s very pretty and good for swimming. It looks more beautiful when it’s clean, but after busy days there can be lots of trash around. It can get overcrowded on weekends and holidays, as boats of people also come from Sayaxche.

We camped right next to the river where we could hear the monkeys howl all day. The river is great for bathing and connecting with the local community. If you want to hike to aguateca it’s 100q for the guide and 20q per person to enter the ruins. For camping its 25q per person. And you can basically put you tent, van or hammock anywhere you want.

There is a number to contact the owner right at the entrance as he lives near the center of the village(see photo).\r\n\r\nHe gave us a price of 30 quetzales for three people per night(2 adults and 1 kid). There's a toilet and cold shower both in good condition. \r\n\r\nThat's the cheapest we have found so far after being on the lake for almost 10 days. \r\n\r\nThis place is more for backpackers. Also a small car/van can enter here though. \r\n\r\nThe patio is clean and looks nice. As the owners rents the rooms for around 1200 quetzales per month they are occupied most of the time by travellers.

These are two caves, B'omb'il Pek and Jul Iq' which you have to hike to for about 40 minutes. We liked it better than the Candelaria caves.\r\n\r\nB'omb'il Pek is a cave you can access by an 85m rappel (or very steep, unprotected stairs). Once in the cave you can crawl your way into a part of the cave with small 1500 yo. carbon drawings (which are a little bit damaged by a cave exploration expedition..). \r\n\r\nThe other cave Jul Iq' has some amazing structures and the light that enters the cave is just beautiful.\r\n\r\nGuides use professional equipment and are trained by ex-military. The income from tourism benefits their community, they explained that over the years it supported the building of a school and common meeting area. They are open to tourists again after 2.5 years of covid closure. \r\n\r\nIt's 75q pp to visit the cave and an extra 75q pp if you want to do the rappel. It's well worth it considering there'll be two guides and the tour is about 4 hours. Bring water, a snack and repellent. They need to know a day in advance, you can WhatsApp them (in Spanish) on +502-4998-7410.","location":{"latitude":15.83509,"longitude":-90.28731},"category":{"name":"Tourist Attraction"}},{"id":186166,"name":"Shaday Gasolinera ","date_verified":"2022-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Gas station with small shop.\r\nThey let me camp on the covered terrasse above the shop.

It is currently the most active volcano in Guatemala. The hike starts in the same place as for Santa Maria, but trends up and right to a shoulder off of Santa Maria. From here you can view Santiaguito, which is constantly active. When we hiked we had huge ash plumes exploding every 30 minutes. We recommend hiking early to arrive by 7:00 for the best views. We hiked with our 6 and 10 year olds, who were fine. It’s not a strenuous hike. I have attached a hand drawn map done by the very knowledgeable Geronimo, who’s parqueadero you can stay at nearby. You will hike up into private land, and through several gates. Please open and then close these gates behind you. The owner of the land is Max, and he allows people to hike on his property. We happened to meet him as he searched for his cows. Very friendly. If he asks for a propina, just pay. It’s his land after all! Take out some trash with you along the way. Max’s land is the land at the Mirador, and you can tell he cares about it there… there was zero trash there and he asked us to help keep it that way! Attached pictures of the hike and the volcano. It’s only about a 5 mile (approx 8km) round trip hike, and took us, with slow kids, about 2 hours to get out there.

I came here during the wet season, so I was all by myself so parking for the night was not an issue. I decided not to park because  there were too many mosquitoes and no bathrooms were available. It was not worth it for me to deal with those in my RTT. So after hiking down to the laguna and seeing it, I decide to campout at the site \"Lake Chicabal - No SWIMMING\". This is where you buy tickets, there is a soccer field and bathrooms are available to you.  \r\n\r\nAt Mirador Chicabal you have the option to take ~500 steps down to the Laguna  or hike the new Sanderos (trail) down. So I took the steps down and hiked up to mirador taking ne w Sanderos to save my old knees. Keep in mind it is very step grade down to the lake. Photos attached for your convenience.\r\n\r\nI hope the sketch clarifies everything.\r\nNote: can you kindly correct the coordinates, if you are at the site.\r\n\r\n","location":{"latitude":14.8333,"longitude":-91.5167},"category":{"name":"Wild Camping"}},{"id":231654,"name":"Difficult water crossing","date_verified":"2023-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","description":"On road 14, we encountered a particularly challenging water crossing. While the depth of the water is subject to change depending on recent rainfall, the real issue lies in the uneven rocky terrain beneath the water's surface. This crossing features solely rocks without any supporting gravel or sand. A sudden drop in the terrain is present and can easily trap an unprepared vehicle.\r\n\r\nThankfully, a knowledgeable local was present to guide us through the difficult crossing. Unfortunately, the stream emanates a rather unpleasant odor, making it a less-than-desirable path to take. \r\n\r\nBeyond the water crossing, road 14 transitions from a paved road to a severely damaged stretch for approximately 14 kilometers. This section features many areas where the road has been eroded, resulting in deep crevices. A 4x4 or a high-clearance vehicle is required to navigate this part of the road.\r\n\r\nUnless off-road adventures are what you seek, a different, less challenging route would be a more desirable option.","location":{"latitude":14.24581,"longitude":-90.59021},"category":{"name":"Warning"}},{"id":231655,"name":"Cajero 5B ATM","date_verified":"2023-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Slightly outside of the city center.

Mostly adding this as a cautionary tale in case someone else tries the same thing later. If you investigate, do it in a VW van or a similarly small vehicle, and do it early in the day so you can find somewhere else if needs be.\r\n\r\nFor whatever it's worth, I'm very used to taking my van into some people's \"small rig only\" kinds of places. Minus the cables, I'd still have gone forward, but it was a bit of a bear backing myself out as it was. I wouldn't recommend pushing your luck on this one.\r\n\r\nEdit: after closer inspection of the satellite view on Google, I think that maps just took me down the wrong road.

Even that was fun and really beautiful (but bumpy; it's a 4x4 track, not luxury ride). \r\nThe bike trails are *super* fun, one way, and well marked, separated, and graded by ability level. They also have pump tracks, jump lines, and hiking only trails if that's your thing.\r\n\r\nPets allowed on leash and on the hiking trails, but my dog is incredibly and obviously well behaved so they told me to let him off. The park and trails are open from 7-4, and I'm guessing they generally care much less about the leash rules after hours, so long as you have a dog who just hangs out with you and doesn't wander.\r\n\r\nNo wifi, but OK Claro 4G depending on where you are in the park. Plenty of open sky for starlink. \r\n\r\nThe only thing that's a bit goofy is that they wouldn't let me move my van into the camping area until after 3:30pm and I'll need to clear off by 9am. I'm not sure if they will let me post up here for multiple days, and as tired as I am after riding, I'm not sure I'll try to find out.\r\nThey also have a huge parking lot that I could have stayed in for free, which has enough flat space for 1-2 vehicles at the far corner. My guess is that this doesn't come with bathroom access. \r\nThere are a couple of switchbacks on the access road, and some slightly low hanging branches that big rigs will scrape, but only 1-2 limbs that you'd need to take care to avoid. For reference, my van is 7.8m long and 3.2m tall, and some roof/brush scraping aside I had zero troubles. It's a one lane road in many places, so expect some backing up and scooting over for other vehicles. \r\n\r\nOf important note is that Google maps SUCKS in this area. SUCKS. SUUUUCKSSAH. It will give you two options off of the main road, neither of which are correct.\r\nIf you come from the north, you take the main road off of the highway, and then enter through a large, blue gate on the right hand side that you will have to wait for a security guard to open. (This place feels *very* secure, btw). \r\nIf you come from the south it's a bit trickier in that you'll need to do some u-turn jiggery on the highway, loop around the backside of the gigantic mega church, pass by both roads that google is going to tell you to take, and look for that same gate. Once through the gate you just stay to the left for ~2km.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that it's a bit expensive, but you get what you pay for on this one.
