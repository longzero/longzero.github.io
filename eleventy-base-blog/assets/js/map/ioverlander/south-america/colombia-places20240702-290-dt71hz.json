In theory you could leave Colombia and return to get another 90 days and use this newer permit (TVIP) to extend giving you 180 days in total. If you leave your vehicle longer than the permitted time you must return with the vehicle to this office where you will be 'sanctioned' i.e. fined, you could then leave Colombia and continue your trip with another 90 days or, as I understood, whatever time you have on your visa. If the vehicle becomes known to the authorities during the time that it is in the country without the owner it will be confiscated on the spot. If you are caught with the vehicle you have five days from thereon to report to the nearest office and pay the fine. After this the vehicle will be taken from you. The fine per month for an overstay is about 60,000 COL. I don't know if there is a maximum 'fine' or if it just ticks on forever. NOTE - if your vehicle is not worth exporting and you want a neat LEGAL way to be rid of it note the following. It's known as voluntarily abandonment. You can start the process here and it takes around a day to sort out. Afterwards the vehicle is taken and you are given proof of this. Remember importing vehicles into Colombia legally is impossible unless it is brand new or over 25 years old.

It’s not too easy to find but as always, to find the gems, you have to dig after them. Alexis and Mathilde (the owners) are a Colombian-German family. They are super friendly and helpful and know the area which helps you to get in touch with for example the owner of a untouristy coffee-finca or the best restaurants.\r\nThe price is 15k per person, per night. You might be able to get a slightly better deal if you stay for more nights. We camped there with a VW-bus. They told us that they’ll accept campers of the same size and a bit bigger (Pickups for example). If you think your camper might be too big, just contact them and ask.\r\nThey offer a clean pool with a view down into the valley. You could also take a private room or a dorm bed there. The showers are the best we’ve seen since leaving the US with hot water and still enough pressure to enjoy.  They have a private natural waterfall close by in which you can cool down after walking in the mountains. There is internet / WIFI but as it’s up in the mountains, it’s not enough to upload photos or videos/ it’s very slow! Their shared kitchen is well equipped and clean so we used it instead of using our own gas. We especially liked the atmosphere in the evening, when everyone gathers around the kitchen. They have a book-exchange too.\r\nAs I mentioned, it’s hard to find: Our GPS didn’t know the small road up the hill!\r\nFrom Medellin follow the road through the tunnel (13000) and drive down until you reach San Jeronimo. There’s an Exito-Supermarket on the right (you might buy some stuff for the days at the finca). Turn right immediately after the Exito and follow the road. Drive left two times until you see the LUXOR Resort. Turn right after the Luxor and follow the dirtroad for approx. 6=7KM’s until you see “Tienda Abraham” take a left here and follow the road until you see the Finca on your left.

After you paid in cash, turn right to the next window and show there, that you have paid both. Go to window 5 and show there also all your papers. Ask them for copys of the bills they are going to keep. You get a form, that allows you to leave the port with your car. You need two copies of this. One is for you, one for the gate, and one for the security guy. Exit Centro de Documento, and go straight to the Centro de Accesso and ask for your vehicle. They wil give you a hv outfit and a helmet. With this you enter the port, and a shuttle bus wil drive you to an office where all your three copies will stamped, you will see your vehicle, and you can drive out.

Go straight and turn right, go straight threw the building, to the next building located behind the first. Ask there at the reception for the, '' FORMULARIO DE IMPORTACION TEMPORAL DE VEHICULOS''. Someone needs to see your Bill from Jans, and will give you than a form. With all details filled in this form, you need to exit DIAN again, and on the other corner of the same crossing where you have to return your security batch, you will find an entrance with a small sign: copy. Make one copy from: JansMar Bill, Vehicle Title, your passport page with your foto, your passport page with the entrance stamp from the airport, the customs Formular from panama for the vehicle (not the one you got from the inspection,it is the one you had already while driving threw panama, but they gave you a new version with details of exiting panama) and your driver license. make also two copies of the form you got from DIAN. With all of this you have to return to DIAN where you got your form and let them do their work with those papers.\nWhile waiting for them to return to you, you still should have one more copy of the DIAN form, because you made two and gave only one set and the original to the officer, and you can get your SOAT insurance.

Administrador Sr. William Nandar can give you permission to visit Mina Real. We had a short tour, down a 30mts elevator shaft right into the mining shafts where men were digging further shafts into the mountain. Or you just drive thru the area for a look: You can see some mining shaft entrances, extracted rocks from the mines and diggers in the river beds. HOW TO GET THERE: 1) FROM THE NORTHI via Chiquinquira - Maripi - Muzo - river bridge (5.52054 -74.05553) - turn off at 5.53105 -74.14424. We drove it in the wet season and there was no way going without a 4x4: Mud, washouts, some very steep ramps. The most horrible stretch was just west of Maripi. (Do not drive south from Maripi, head west!). Driving time around 4hrs. FROM THE SOUTH: (we describe the route from north to south) From the mines head up the very steep road and then rurn right. The road heads west to Anatena landing strip and to the little town of Quipama. Some streches need definitively a 4x4. At the plaza (5.51936 -74.17861) head south (downhill) respectively right if you drive the other direction. Always follow the main road southwards. At Quatro Caminos (5.33453 -74.18768) head right (resp. left). From here the roads gets much better. Cross the river bridge at 5.30588 -74.19453. Later you will get to Villagimez (5.27570 -74.19585) and after about 4hrs to the iOverlander panorama camp at chapel. Cross river bridge at 5.17834 -74.19315 . From here it is a potholed bitumen road to Pasto (45min) and to the salt church of Zipaquiea (2hrs). Total driving time 6hrs.

(Leave space for passing cows and riders). One of the very few spots which is not on privat property where one can stay for a night. From here it is a 4 hrs drive to the emerald mines near Muzo.

We were passing by this authorized Nissan dealership / mechanic and the owner came out to take a picture of our chilean Nissan and asked if we need something done - in my life, I had mostly bad experience with the authorized dealers but I gave in and we had them check it.\r\nThey quickly said that some support of the engine is causing the noise and needs to be replaced - and that the oil leak is from some bearing or seal and it needs replacing too. Could not even give us an estimate saying how much it would roughly cost and we had to leave the car there. I told them I don't want anything done until I know how much it would be (always do that btw). They wanted me to sign some paper that they will do an inspection - I didn't sign. When I asked if that's free, they said no... about 80 000 COP. Go figure...\r\nNext morning, we came there and after waiting 3 hours they gave us estimate for about 1.5 million COP (500 usd!) - I almost laughed, looked at the list of things - and saw there changing of timing belt, coolant, the seal and the engine support.\r\nWe thanked them (for nothing), left and went to Freddy Toyota. The best part comes now.\r\nThe oil leak wasn't caused by any seal, just by some small hole somewhere that they quickly fixed. And the noise was no engine support, just needed to tighten some nuts :) So both problems were diagnosed badly, or they actually lied to us. Freddy fixed it in 1 day and for 200 000COP, so 1/8th of the price.\r\nKeep away from authorized dealers, sorry to say that.

He also has a lookout point you can walk to (5 minutes, easy) from his house, there you'll have an absolutely stunning view of the whole canyon (and get 4G signal). \n\nNOTE: When you follow this road, lead by some signs towards Jordan you'll drive down a gravel path only suitable for vehicles with 4x4 or motorcycles. Some short steep parts, but nothing crazy. You'll have to open a three gates to reach this point. Just remember to close them behind you, it's for the sheep not to run off.\n\nYou can walk down to Jordan from here along the trail, or maybe pay one of the ranches around here to rent a horse for the day. It's apparently a popular hike.\n\nAnyhow, it's a true treat and I hope many of you will go here.","location":{"latitude":6.706253006773012,"longitude":-73.12285238309308},"category":{"name":"Informal Campsite"}},{"id":31398,"name":"Biker Stock Colombia","date_verified":"2018-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","description":"You want new tires?

The parking lot is a short walk from the bus terminal in Ipiales. \r\n\r\nIpiales is sort of the no-man's land between the borders, so it is possible to turn in your temporary import permit to the DIAN (you do not need to stamp out first), flip a U-Turn back into Ipiales and park for the long-term. You can do the u-turn right before the bridge, after you've gone past the sheltered area for refugees.\r\n\r\nWe traveled from Cartagena, and turned the paperwork in at the Ipiales border before turning around and parking lot. Upon returning to the truck we will finish the rest of South America.\r\n\r\nThis strategy works for south-bound travel at the least, but I'm sure you could also make it work for northbound travel.

So far great Job! we are on the road after a 3 day repair; they started right away.\r\n\r\nThey cleaned every part consciously, checking if it had faults and where before screws were too long etc. they replaced them; even little details. In comparison to Mexico parts and their work were more expensive, but I believe it was better quality all the way.  \r\n\r\nThey have a big entry and a big hall; big rigs are only restricted by the cars parked in the street. We mesure h-3m, l-7m, w-2,5m and had no issues at all! No English was spoken, and only one guy there slowed his talking speed for me to understand, but i guess at Technomoritz across the street you could ask for translation help. They had a really detailed service  manual for the automatic. They consulted it and followed it perfectly (as far as i can tell). \r\n\r\nI willpPost if we break down but i have a good feeling.\r\n\r\nThe only only bummer was that they did not give me a price until they finished and even though i stood next to them all thee days (i learned a lot) they did not give me a price of parts they would change. E.g. all of a sudden someone came in a car, with a repair kit (all the discs again, although some were still good from Mexico. However, also in Mexico a complete kit was cheaper than the single two broken disks and the seals) \r\nHe said \"good quality, original\" in Spanish (what it looked like) Then he drove me to a bank to pay him COP 903.000. \r\nMade in Mexico by an original Ford parts replacement company with a bigger non metal automatic fluid filter against overheating. I liked that José, the owner,  made clear that he was not changing extra. I payed the external deliverer. but still every time I asked how much he said \"We will see, I'll give you a good price when it works.\"\r\nThey had all pieces for an almost identical diesel automatic, which are stronger than the gasoline ones and fitted them, so i think now we are prepared for the Andes; only time will tell.  \r\n\r\nI hate automatics,  but there was no other option in Canada for sale. \r\nWe had our automatic taken apart thee times by two different mechanics in Mexico. changed gear discs and some other stuff.

It took us three days there and back. You can camp at various places: la Pastora (2 hours), El Jordan (6 hours), la Escuela (at el bosque, 7-8 hours, at 3600 m) or the laguna itself (10 hours, at 4000m). We camped the first night at El Jordan, then went to la escuela, left our heavy stuff there and continued to the laguna and back. It's super beautiful,  but come prepared for rain. In the camping places that we mentioned there will be a shelter for cooking (bring your camping stove, fires are not allowed). El Jordan also has a couple of beds if you don't want to carry a tent etc. From there you can also make it to the laguna and back in one day. Just check availability (google?) in holidays. La Pastora is a nice place with beds (many!) only a 2 hour walk from el Cedral and a nice base for some nice short hikes through this amazing dense forest with all its waterfalls. \n\nWe left our car here at el Cedral without problems for 3 days, but you might consider leaving it in la Florida and take the chiva (bus) to el Cedral for the following reasons: 1. the road is bad. You need high clearance and it will take you much longer than the chiva. 2. we slept at el cedral the nighy before we started,  but that was a mistake: loud music all night long ( literally, it was still playing when we left in the morning). When I asked whether they always play their music all night long she said: yes we always have music... So be warned🙂\n\nFor the rest, enjoy this hike! It's so beautiful that we don't understand why its not more popular. We met only one other couple. (Perhaps because of the wheather?). Oh, and good to know, you don't have to pay any entrance fee for the national park here, just some small camping fees (6000 at el jordan, the escuela was free, but we don't know whether that's always the case).

No parking but street parking for a car seems safe enough. I parked my bike at the neighbours house.\r\nThe village is small but nice to see. Especially in the evening, when everybody is out, we enjoyed being here.\r\n\r\n This is currently the only hotel in Toche, and is the only option if you want a hotel along the road from Salento to Ibagué. They have 3 dorms with numerous bunk beds in threes, rooms are very basic although the beds are sturdy. Dorms are interconnecting so people can (and do) move between them to get to the bathrooms. Towels and thick blankets provided. Cold showers and two toilets, bring your own loo roll. There aren't any restaurants in the town, and although the owner has a big kitchen and cooks for residents, she refused to cook for us, saying she had used up all her food already and could only offer us the burnt rice at the bottom of the pan. Luckily we had food with us, and asked if we could use the kitchen to cook. She agreed but only if we didn't use any of her things, even the gas or firewood - we had to use our own stove on top of hers! One of our party was ill and she forgot twice after we asked for a hot drink for her. She asked for 25,000 per person, which we contested based on the very basic service and how unhelpful she had been! eventually paid 20,000. She offered breakfast for 8,000 each but there is a little cafe to the right of the square that did the same for 4,000.\r\n","location":{"latitude":4.5202086,"longitude":-75.4093043},"category":{"name":"Hotel"}},{"id":40205,"name":"Trailhead to Paramo de Oceta Trail","date_verified":"2024-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Incredibly beautiful Place.

Here you decide which road to take.  If you go straight, it's the road that comes up easy on most OSM maps and on maps.me - it goes through El Jardin (@ 2.172272, -74.274522).  We drove this eastbound. It was 138 km from the Terpel station outside San Vicente to La Macarena.\r\n\r\nIf you go right here, it's the truck/bus route which is harder to find on maps.  We drove this westbound.  It's about 162 km from La Macarena to the aforementioned Terpel.\r\n\r\nBoth are dirt/gravel mix, both are tricky when wet and, for both, high clearance is needed.\r\n\r\nThe more challenging is the first route: 4x4 a definite advantage, and a must if wet (it rains here almost year round -  notice how green it is?) so you're bound to hit bad sections and there are steeper grades.  There are at least two dozen small, narrow bridges, (these bridges do not have railings or overheads though), two of which we had to \"rebuild\" before crossing.  There are two tolls of 7000 and 10,000 COP each.  Keep your receipts for the return trip.\r\n\r\nThe trucker route is wider in more sections, has no wooden bridges, you pass through larger villages than other route and there are more gravel-less mud sections but still lots of potential for slipping in the rain with soft \"shoulders\" especially in the second half. --As of Aug 2023 there are 3 tolls of 5K, 10K, and 10K on this route. --\r\n\r\nHere are the waypoints for the truck route from this point heading east to assist in taking this route as we had to force our maps to go this way and were assisted by locals enroute to plan it:\r\n- 2.091888, -74.433853\r\n- 2.062654, -74.366702 (town of La Sombra near here)\r\n- 2.061719, -74.248158\r\n- 1.972012, -74.145249 (El Recreo airport nearby which comes up on maps.me but we saw no actual road to it.....)\r\n- 2.077541, -73.974543\r\n- 2.148418, -73.87913\r\nFrom here you'll hit a right turn up ahead and that road will take you right to La Macarena.  You could now put in coordinates for your destination in town.\r\n\r\nHave fun!  We did; we were two rigs and each had to winch out the other on the challenging road at different points! We are 85\" wide so JUST made the narrow bridges. There are a few you could go around through the creek as water was not too deep when we were going.\r\n\r\n","location":{"latitude":2.149867,"longitude":-74.483742},"category":{"name":"Warning"}},{"id":44875,"name":"Uzaque","date_verified":"2024-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Recreation area with camping in the grassy parking lot next to the basketball court.

It has tent camping areas near the pool. We parked in front of the main building on level ground. Toilets are basic (no seat, no paper) but cleaned daily. The six showers are simple (a pipe) in a communal shower room; there are private booths for changing. There is a small store for beer and such, but you can order-ahead a lunch, and the friendly staff will cook something for you. The soup and empanadas we ate were homemade and very good.\nBeing a community pool, it can be busy, especially on weekends. Of course, there is music during the day, but at a tolerable volume when local folks use the pool. During the six days we were here, including a weekend, it was always quiet by 7 pm.\nWe were the only campers during our off-season stay. We paid 10k Pesos per person per night. We did not use the pool. Electricity is available by extension chord; we didn’t need any.\nGaragoa has an immense Ceiba tree in the center in its plaza! There is a local market every day, bigger on Thursdays and biggest on Sundays. Do try the Arepas Boyacenses made fresh daily over a charcoal fire.\nWe used this small town as a base to visit villages in the area; very authentic, tranquil, and enjoyable. We hired a taxi with local driver for a full day. Ask the pool staff for recommendations.","location":{"latitude":5.088604379367181,"longitude":-73.3666942327087},"category":{"name":"Established Campground"}},{"id":53398,"name":"Roadside","date_verified":"2018-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","description":"very quiet at night. perfect to rest after 38 km after ugly dirt road. good leveled, for big riggs even for a bunch oft motorhomes.","location":{"latitude":2.045665,"longitude":-76.30466500000001},"category":{"name":"Wild Camping"}},{"id":53478,"name":"Tena Plaza - free","date_verified":"2023-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Tena is a peaceful small village.

Then they worked slowly on rebuilding the engine (about a week) and re-mounting it(almost a week as well). Then a new problem appeared : a deep cloud of blue smoke coming from the exhaust and other less critical problems too.\r\nOne week, the issue isn't yet solved and I decided to leave to Barranquilla at a workshop where they're specialised in diesel.\r\nThey're not bad, they're coastal... Their style of working doesn't have any standard, still they are capable to fix plenty of things, but I would avoid expecting big issues to be fixed smoothly here, so be careful.

It was recommended on my request by a Ford parts dealer in Bogotá (Henry in Henford), and I'm so happy I found this gem! The owner, Diego Andres is quite a talent, very competent and almost maniac in checking all the details. He's definitely customer-oriented, he made sure that our truck is totally fine before hitting the road again. Besides, Bucaramanga is THE right place to fix a vehicle, it's got thousands of parts stores and specialists for everything and anything. We got our International 7.3 IDI diesel engine fully rebuilt; even the crankshaft was fixed in a specialised workshop (see separate entry I made). Totally amazing what these guys are capable of, and for a fraction of the price it would cost in the west. Best of all is total transparency on the costs and at no time felt being cheated, almost the opposite I would say, because even after spending much more time than planned (2.5 weeks), Diego hardly charged me more. We camped inside the workshop most of this time, there's WiFi, basic toilets and a shower, it's very quiet at night. Contact him in advance if you can, his excellent reputation keeps him quite busy.

Ecosistemas), \r\n- go on your own and contract a 4x4 for up to eight people (COP 350,000) or for up to three people (COP 280,000) with one of the several transport agencies in town (e. g. Destinos \u0026 Rutas), \r\n- drive to Potosí with your own 4x4, bicycle or motorcycle. It's a very scenic three to four hours drive, but due to the road conditions high clearance is strongly advised. \r\n\r\nThe not so obvious one - \r\nGet in touch with Señor Serafín, a friendly \"lechero\" driving from the Cruzero Villamaría (leaving at 4.30am) to El Bosque (a 45 minutes walk from Potosí) several times a week in order to collect milk from the various fincas along the way. \r\nI believe Serafín could fit up to two people in his truck and charges COP 20,000 per person. The very scenic drive takes approximately three to four hours, depending on the road conditions.\r\nAs he not only takes tourists with him, but occasionally also people living in the fincas, it's advised to reserve a seat in his truck with a few days anticipation. Serafín only speaks Spanish. \r\nPhone/WhatsApp: +57 310 8367873\r\n\r\nAt Potosí you will need to pay the entrance fee to the national park (COP 37,500 for foreigners). From here you can hike to the Laguna del Otún in the Valle del Cóndor where you will find a ranger station to camp and stay at for the night. You could also do a round trip to the lagoon and spend the night camping or in the cabañas in Potosí and try to arrange a transport back to Manizales from there. \r\nThe ambitious should look into the very extensive, yet a bit confusing trail system of the Parque Los Nevados and consider crossing the national park on a (depending on your route) four to five day long trek. MAPS.ME seems to have all of the official and various unofficial trails listed. \r\nAs always, it's advised to go in dry season, but it's not impossible to do the treks in the rainy months neither.

It’s packed with backpackers everyday, you need to book weeks in advance. Basically a wooden house on stilts in the middle of the ocean near the San Bernardos islands. You can get a private room, dorm or hammock - it’s pretty pricey though, we paid $25 per night for a hammock. Jump right off the hostel decking into the bright blue ocean. They run tours like snorkelling and night time tours to see the bioluminescence (best I’ve ever seen!). Lunch and dinner is freshly caught seafood - the fisherman sails up to the hostel every morning with his catches! Very much a party hostel vibe at night, don’t come here expecting to get an early night! You can get a 2h boat from Cartagena for 100k per person, but we drove to Rincon del Mar and joined on a snorkel tour for 50k each which dropped us at the hostel.

They kindly let our dog stay but their cat hates dogs so I’m not sure they would always allow it. Great food too, one meal on offer which changes every day. Maybe it’s because they’re Italian but the best pizza I’ve had in such a long time!

The farm also has (2.5) cows and goats and some fowl.\r\n\r\nThe entire process of coffee growing is shown: from seed to small plants in a pot to harvesting the fruits on a full grown plant, (mechanically) peeling them, drying, (manually) sorting etc. Any question is welcome (including technical ones): about biologically circular systems to what fertilizer is used. Or about the 'why' for the plastic bags around the bananas.\r\n\r\nOnce the beans are peeled, dried and selected, they are sold (most through a 'cooperativa' to Nestlé), but the tour does not stop there: you get to roast beans in a pan, 'casera' style, grind them and make coffee (using 'aguapanella' if you'd like). And then drink coffee 'grown here, harvested here, roasted here, brewn here', part of which you participated in. (Another part of the harvest is available, professionally roasted and ground, in local stores (and this farm), under the name 'Valcafé'.)\r\n\r\nWe found this small scale farm a great place to learn about the process and the individual nature of the tour (we were only two, and Alejandro) made that we had all of our questions answered.\r\n\r\nAlejandro speaks Spanish, but adapts to foreigners  (in the sense that he knows to speak slowly and explain again using other words).

Embalse el Hato is an artificial lagoon run by CAR, a Colombian environmental institution so facilities are well maintained. Services include : Toilets with warm showers (at our last visit, only the ladies shower worked) there are several grills. Price for camping is a flat tariff of $30.000 per person for up to 3 nights. We spent four nights so $5.000 per night, fairly cheap considering the various services. A recent addition is free bike rental. So you can make the 10kms nice ride along the lake. You can buy wood for the night or also rent a kayak. Plenty of garbage bins, so please use them. During weekdays, the place is almost empty.  This is the best time for camping and relaxing before going into Bogota or north towards Villa de Leyva, Tunja Or Bucaramanga. There are several camping entrances along the lake so choose your favorites. Toilets are only in the main camping area which is nice as it has a big flat area. 24hrs Safety. Park rangers are really nice. let them know if you need something. In the corner before the lake, there is a small store at the top of the hill selling various items, also food and drinks. If you come to visit the old colonial Hacienda located 2kms past the lake, a 200-yr Building from the ancient landlord of this land is being restored. Here they provide also Cabin rentals if you wish to stay warmer. Enjoy and take care of the place. \r\n\r\nDrive here via Ubate to avoid bad road. From Ubate it’s just fine.

It is a good option if the river is high or is raining and you afraid that river goes up (it was our case in these 2 nights).

We saw that they also make aluminium boxes, roof tent, rain covers, and all 4x4 projects... Come here and you will fix everything you need in the car! Rafa is his mechanic, he is also very friendly and very knowledgeable. There is no high limit and the place is well located, you can find everything you need, there is Sodimac (homecenter), supermarket (D1), etc...

We did in on motos but no doubt in a 4x4 camper or truck you’ll get bounced around… it’s not challenging just 40 kms of rough get tiring after a while.\r\n\r\nLike I said, glad we came, we spent 2 nights at the restaurant / soon to be hotel camping in one of there rooms.\r\n\r\n2/ you have to leave your vehicle at the ranger station and from there it’s a 5.5km walk to the base of the mirador hill. It’s not an exciting or particularly scenic walk. It’s an all beat up access road, slippery in certain section when it rains, lots of lose pebble type rocks, not particularly pleasant, and that 11ams return!\r\n\r\n3/ the hike up to the mirador is steep and you are at 4000 meters. The view however (if the weather plays nice) is stunning! But in my opinion the mirrador views alone don’t warrant the 11kms hike HOWEVER… if you have a few more kms left in you and you want to get adventurous there are some amazing trails up here (see photos) we ended up hiking a total of 17kms and 6 of those made it worth while. The trails aren’t super obvious or marked but, with a gps or a decent app on your phone you can do great things here!\r\n\r\n4/ the weather… it all hinges on the weather. Most mornings are clear from sunrise to about 9:30 then the fog rolls in and well, there goes your lake views! And then around mid day we got rain. Talking to the locals that seems to be the trend (at least for the last 2 years) we started our hike at 0700 and headed back when it started to rain around 12:30… back at camp by 14:00.\r\nSo yeah, plan on going early which means, either start driving up at about 3:30am or sleeping up here (which we did) but consider temps at night are close to or just below freezing. There is only one sleeping option up here right now (see other post)\r\n\r\nThat’s about the extent of its, it’s a shame that 1- access road is so beat up and 2 that you can’t drive to the lake and start hiking from there (where it gets really good) walking 11 kms to get to the start of a good hiking spot with about 7 hours of decent weather window seems a bit of a waste but, doesn’t seem that park people have much interest in it all… shame really.\r\nAlso, no shelter, the mirador itself is falling apart (probably shouldn’t go up it) and when it starts to rain, it gets cold real quick so plan for all seasons up here!\r\n\r\n","location":{"latitude":4.80213,"longitude":-75.41399},"category":{"name":"Tourist Attraction"}},{"id":170635,"name":"Hotel Dulces Sueños","date_verified":"2023-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Cheap, convenient hotel 5 blocks from main square, gated parking for at least 8 cars on ground floor of building, so height restriction to get in.\r\nPaid 60,000 for a double room, (2 people) private bathroom, hot water.","location":{"latitude":4.86858,"longitude":-75.62306},"category":{"name":"Hotel"}},{"id":170648,"name":"Casa Campo Emaus","date_verified":"2024-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Sofie and her husband David welcomed us on their enormous property.\r\nThere's a natural pond where you can fish, small hiking trails through the woods, an exterior bath, a very nice gym, a football field, exterior kitchen and bathrooms, mango trees among other fruit trees are scattered along the garden.\r\nThey recently opened this place up as a hotel, it used to be their vacation home, so there are room upgrades.\r\nIt's all gated, it's gotta be a couple of hectars easily.

The place is incredibly beautiful and quiet, surrounded by nature and has direct access to the river with natural pools. Lots of space to camp on nice grassy area. Everything is very clean and well-arranged. No mosquitoes - which is rare in this area.\r\n\r\nIt is located just 5 minutes from the entrance of Tayrona Park but we saw more animals here than in the park (tons of birds, huge iguanas, monkeys, we even saw Cottontop Tamarins who are almost extinct!!). \r\n\r\nFrom here you can also hike in the jungle or until Las Cocos beach, rent horses, etc, just ask and they'll be pleased to help, there's a lot to do.\r\n\r\nThe food from the restaurant/bar was delicious, probably the best we've had in Colombia, including vegetarians/vegans options and cocktails.\r\n\r\nBruno knows everything about mechanics and has a big garage with lots of tools in case you need to work on your truck/car/bike.\r\n\r\nTo get there you'll need to cross the small village of San Rafael, there's a sign from the main road. Then head down the steep dirt road (4x4 mandatory during rain season) which leads to the first river to cross.The water level really depends of the rains but anyway you'll need high clearance. We crossed with motorbikes and it was okay. Then follow the signs and cross the second river (smaller) to get to the hotel.\r\n\r\nThey put up some drone shots showing how to access on their instagram account so people can figure out if its doable or not : @barranquero.hotel\r\nI put a screenshot of the first river crossing (the river was low).\r\n\r\nLast but not least : they have optical fiber so the internet is very fast and there is a super chill working space above the restaurant.\r\n\r\nPrice : 20.000 COP pp, definitely worth it.

This is an official Koju (google it) store, which is owned and managed by Billy - really knowledgeable an helpful pal (he’s also a motorcyclist). Here’s what he can help you with:\r\n\r\n1. Since this is a Koju dealer, you can get both top and side aluminum cases and accessories (racks, internal bags etc.) for them. They aren’t as good, as the ones from, say, Givi, but overall it’s a really good price/quality ratio.\r\n2. Billy has its own production of waterproof saddlebags, so you can order them here. You can choose the size, design etc. Might take a week or two to get them ready, but he can also send them to you across the country (I used this option, since didn’t want to wait).\r\n3. Finally, you can order practically any kind of metalworks for your bike: side-racks, top rack, crash-bars etc. Billy organizes the whole process with one of the specialized nearby workshops, which includes the design, quality control etc.\r\n\r\nI personally fulfilled all 3 points from above, and can’t recommend enough this service. Now, when I’m adding this place, I have more then 6 months of travelling with the new gear without any serios issues. If you’re curious about the prices: top rack + side racks + 47L top case + 2x 35L saddlebags costed me about $650 in total.","location":{"latitude":4.65278,"longitude":-74.07275},"category":{"name":"Mechanic and Parts"}},{"id":206689,"name":"Cmplejo Tuiristico Patacoré","date_verified":"2024-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Right next to the “Patacoré” complex, there is a small hotel which can also accommodate vans/motorhomes.

It's incredibly difficult to get accurate information especially in English. The official park website offers inaccurate information, the biggest being that you need to register 30 days in advance, you don't.\r\nWhat you need to know is this. There is no camping in the park. There are 3 hiking trails which you need a guide and have to register for ahead before entering the park. You have to register at a park office located in the town of El Cocuy or Guican and they are closed for lunch 11-2. In order to register you need daily insurance 9000/day/person (which you purchase across street a couple doors down, that's where it is in El Cocuy) and a guides name to put on the permit. Permit costs 85000/person good for 4 days. Where to find the guide is still a mystery to us. The website says there is a list on the wall we didn't see one and there wasn't any guides hanging around the office. You also have to watch a video on the park which is viewed via Google Meet twice a day once in the morning and afternoon, they will give the meeting details at the office. We were put in contact with Ivan after making many frustrating calls. Ivan is a park guide and speaks reasonable English. He was unable to actually guide us himself due to an injury but he did meet us at the park office to walk us through the insurance and registration process. He made all the arrangements for; guides for 2 days of hiking, transportation from town to La Esperanza lodge with our bikes, lodging and meals and transport for us and our bikes to the trailhead for the second hike. We tried for several frustrating days just trying to get info let alone make any progress on arrangements. He went on and above making our visit to the park happen and doing so for whatever commission he must make from the various services not his normal guide wage. He and his family are wonderful people and we literally couldn't have done it without him.

They warned us that there was much Guerilla activity in the area (showed us pictures of arrests the previous evening) and if we happen to get stopped at a checkpoint on our intended route then it is probably Guerillas. Green Military camouflage uniform without Colombian flag on the arm. We should play dumb, speak only our own language, don't show our passports and generally act like we don't understand anything and they will let us pass.\r\nSure enough not 10 minutes outside of town there was such a roadblock with 4 armed men wearing the described uniforms. We did mostly as the police said we should, mostly saying over and over we didn't understand when they wanted us to get out of the vehicle for a pat down to check for arms and to open up and search the vehicle. We did show some vehicle documents which seemd to placate them somewhat. After enough of refusing to do anything they wanted by acting dumb they let us go. Without the warning from the police I am not sure we would have reacted as we did or have been aware that they were not real military.

She had family in town so there was only one non-air conditioned room available (there was a big fan) but normally has both double and single rooms with AC, private or shared bath, a nice big shared kitchen etc (prices on Expedia were $8-20 USD for a weeknight). We asked if we could camp and she was open to it - asked for $60K COP but accepted $50K. She opened up an outdoor bathroom for us with cold shower (no curtain) and welcomed us to use the big palapa area with hammocks. Liliana was very kind and welcoming and encouraged us to add this location to iOverlander. It has been a restaurant in the past and she is working on reopening the restaurant and pool. Be sure to message her on WhatsApp before coming as she’s not always in town and is new to the camping option. \r\n\r\nWhatsApp - Liliana - 57 314 6714508","location":{"latitude":8.3750449,"longitude":-75.5470827},"category":{"name":"Hotel"}},{"id":232459,"name":"Money exchange","date_verified":"2023-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Inside building you can find the money exchange ","location":{"latitude":5.056821157916814,"longitude":-75.48579493945707},"category":{"name":"Financial"}},{"id":232478,"name":"Multicar Cota bodywork and spray painting ","date_verified":"2023-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Good place to fix rust, bodywork and spraypainting.

The park doesn’t really start here, but you kind of walk into the wild here. \r\n\r\nStatus of the PNN as of August 2023 is “no one really knows”. Some people say just the north part is closed, some say the whole park is closed.\r\n\r\nAnyway we just went in here and saw some beautiful views of the paramos, volcanos and the jungle. You can stay and eat at fincas: Argentina, Buenos Aires, Primavera (we had been at all three for food on the way - price is 15k COP per person) and La Playa. No payments anywhere for the park (except for the Cocora Valley if you go through the paid part). We met some Colombians who hiked one of the volcanoes - no one cares really. It is super cold and windy above 3800 m so be prepared. \r\n\r\nWe had our tent with us and you can camp at fincas (usually around 7k per person) or in the wild in the park. We used the maps.me to look for the wild spots. Use MAPS.ME for navigating in the park, it shows all the paths, but you have to note that they are little bit longer and take more time than app indicates due to mud, elevation change and other factors. \r\n\r\nGood luck and have fun. Talk to the locals and people in fincas/campings and so on. If you really want a guide people usually go with a company Paramo Trek from Salento.

You also pay a community toll here of 15K COP, and a there is a restaurant/hospedaje across the street where we paid 30K COP for the two of us to camp in our truck. \r\n\r\nIt appears to be quite rare that travellers make it this far on their own, most come on tours from La Macarena, however we were warmly welcomed by this community and were made to feel very safe and looked after. This is a 100% community-organized and run tourism operation managed by the small community of campesinos who live in this area. The fee to visit the sites is 100K COP per person for a wristband that allows access to the three sites. A guide is mandatory, the cost for the guide is 110K COP per site visited no matter the size of the group. We were told there are no guides who speak english, however they have interpreters available to hire. If you do not have space in your vehicle to transport the guide from here to the site, make that clear to the people who are finding the guide for you so they find one with a moto. \r\n\r\nWe are a couple and visited 2 sites, so we paid 420K COP in total. While this is expensive, it is far cheaper than Cano Cristales, and all of the funds stay within this community that receives minimal support or resources from the government. \r\n\r\nSee the Cano Canoas pin for details there. Siete Machos is close to this pin and is a beautiful canyon with many small to medium-sized waterfalls and large sections where the Macarena plant grows red yellow and green. The hike took us 3 ½ hours with several options to swim. The hiking is rough, a lot of slippery rocks and sketchy sections. While the hiking and access to the river is far less developed, we found Siete Machos as or more striking than Cano Cristales. It was high season and there we only saw one other group on this trail. \r\n\r\nOur guide Zenaida Zubieta studied tourism and started a tour agency. She can organize package tours with food and lodging if you want to try to pre-arrange your tour. She was excellent and can be contacted at +573144629547\r\n\r\nIt is closed during low/dry season and reopens in Semana Santa.

The incredible sites of Caño Canoas and Siete Machos, and other attractions lie 2 - 3 hours further. Things to know before you go: This is an independent community of campesinos who live with very little support from the government. The military or police are not present out there. There are community tolls on the roads as well as a community fee on visiting the attractions that go directly to support the maintenance of the roads, running of schools, and development of tourism. As participants in this tourism, we felt incredibly welcomed and invited in this community, but this is not a place to go to camp wild and try to avoid fees. We highly recommend getting current local information in La Macarena before driving this route. \r\n\r\nA high clearance 4x4 is required. In addition to the very rough and muddy state of the road depending on weather, the bridges are built by the community and must be evaluated individually, we needed to cross one muddy creek that was 40-60CM deep. (We had our guide with us for Cano Canoas at that point and she said the bridge is not safe for vehicles.)  \r\n\r\nTo get to Cano Indio and then to Cano Canoas, you must cross the Rio Guayabero on a ferry about 10KM east of La Macarena. Mapping apps will try to take you west of La Macarena, however this route is closed, it is only for the tourism operation to Cano Cristales. To get to the ferry, you want to drive through this pin. There is a large bridge well constructed bridge here, we were told the one over this river farther north is not in good shape. Then you want to drive toTres Esquinas and take a left, then the intersection located at 2.197584, -73.751518. We paid a toll of 10K COP there and carried on to the ferry over the Río Guayabero. The entry/exit to the ferry was a steep muddy slope where lumber was used to aid in getting on the ferry. From there  there is basically only one route north to Cano Canoas, where we stopped and returned, however it eventually goes to Vista Hermosa. Travel time is 2-3 hours La Macarena -Cano Canoas, and 4-5 hours Cano Canoas to Vista Hermosa. \r\n\r\nHave fun….\r\n\r\n","location":{"latitude":2.17117,"longitude":-73.767064},"category":{"name":"Warning"}},{"id":238168,"name":"Hostal/Camping La Calera ","date_verified":"2023-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","description":"We are really excited to share this hidden gem. A great stop on the route to/from La Macarena, Hostal La Calera also could be a destination in its own right. \r\n\r\nAt the entrance, there is a large open air restaurant with delicious food and views over the valley. The property is a decent sized finca that descends down to the Rio Hacha, with areas for camping and cabanas dispersed among fish ponds. Owner Dufrán owns a supercool old landrover with a pop-top and is very helpful with information about attractions in the area. They regularly host groups of Colombian campers on the weekend, though \"there is always space\" according to the owner. For our two stays during the week we had it to ourselves. The drive down to the camping area is paved with stones and concrete but very steep with a switchback in the middle. We used 4x4 low range to get out, if you have 2wd best to walk it first. There is also a height restriction, but it's pretty high, more than 3 m? \r\n\r\n\r\nThe real gem is the access to the Rio Hacha.

You hike through a river bed and through three canyons. The third canyon is almost a slot canyon and around 1-2 meters wide and an estimated 20m high. In the canyon you have to wade through hip deep water (we were there during dry season, so after heavy rain it might not be passable). Guacharos living in the third canyon, so don't be afraid of the sounds that you will be hearing there. It's one of the most amazing birds. Do not point on them with a torch as they can't handle the light and will actually die from too much light. Just enjoy the sounds. Lots of other endemic species living there as well (there are some signs with information). \r\n\r\nWear appropriate footwear as you have to walk through water and over rocks all the time. Also just wear clothes that can get wet. Multiple options to swim and cool off under waterfalls. The whole track there and back again took us 3,5 hours. You can do it quicker or spend even more time. \r\n\r\nYou can camp at Hostal El Pauji at the trail head. They can either organize a guide or you just go alone for free (what we preferred).

No height restriction for entry, but narrow streets and some tight corners approaching the entry probably restrict length to about 7m. The parking lot itself has lots of open parking area and some covered, depending on your needs. There are absolutely no services here so you must be completely self-contained and -supported. The lot itself is staffed from 8:00 am every day until 8pm M-F, 9pm Sat, 7pm Sun. Those are the official hours but our attendant left earlier on a Saturday night. This is important because the main gate is closed when they leave. Access to/from the lot after the attendant leaves is enabled by staff of the tienda (a round, pink building) in the roundabout outside the entrance to the lot until it 11:00 pm or when the tienda closes. We paid the 24 hour rate (16,500 COP) and spent the night, which was relatively quiet considering it was the opening weekend of Semana Santa. We appear to be the first to have spent the night in our vehicle and no one seemed to mind. The town itself is quite charming and prices were what might be expected of rural Colombia. People were very friendly and judging by the attention we garnered we may be the only foreign tourists in town. The drive from Barbosa is quite scenic, but be aware that about 1/4 of the distance is not paved and in very rough condition in spots. Still doable by 2WD vehicle when dry.
