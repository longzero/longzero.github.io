My friends told me that she had spent a super comfortable night opposite in a lot of other place. It is an animal reserve. Having no source of water, the reserve has pink into the ground to make a water point for animals to drink. You can see tapirs, jaguars, biches and other animals! The man being the guardian will be happy to show you the videos of the night cameras present in the park! This man is really kind and will be at your disposal for everything and will explain the park, these animals and what you need to continue your way. He asked us no money for nothing and also offered beers. It was a super nice evening and frankly I started all to stop at this place. There is a kitchen available to cook, a shower with hot water and the place is clean!
